We made our apts for 2:00 (I realize that they happened to be short-staffed but still).. I didn't get my nails done until almost 3:00 & it took OVER 2 HOURS. I had somewhere to be at 5:00, so clearly I did not make it there. The fact that someone that said they had been doing acrylics for 6 years took that long on my nails for them to not even turn out that great was a little upsetting. Also, my nails are uneven/not smooth. I will not return.", "date": "2017-12-31 00:07:37", "compliment_count": 0}
