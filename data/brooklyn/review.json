Yes--Penn Station. Everything about this place is so darn good! I love their bred and the subs are always so fresh and perfectly made. The adults always gravitate to the steak and cheese or the hot Italian. My kids love to get the chicken teriyaki. No matter what you get, it is always so good.   \nTheir fries are the absolute best and you cannot leave without trying these. They rival my homemade ones and that is something to say as mine are pretty darn good.  Also, the cookies--yes, they are shaped like a square--are so fresh and homemade tasting.\nThe service here is pretty good, I have been here on occasion when it seems to take a bit longer than I want, but I guess that is to be expected.\nOverall, Penn Station is a win win for tasty subs and fries.

He asked all the right questions - you know, the ones you don't want to answer (yes I sleep in my contacts, yes I know its gross and dangerous) - but never made you feel judged.

Although most of the gifts were perfect a few of the harnesses and clothing did not fit my big bullies chests. One of the coats I brought into the store and asked to do an even exchange for the correct size( I even showed the manager the picture of my dog in the coat) and from the beginning she was not accommodating and rude (her name was Angel). I had other items that I wanted to do an even exchange for but a larger size and she informed me that did not come from her store but the coat did. I asked her if she could help me find a larger size in the coat and she said you're just going to have to look for yourself all the clothes are down there and pointed (full well knowing there was nothing but small sizes of all the clothes). The store was not busy at all there was not one other customer in it and she full well could have accompanied me to the clothing aisle.  I came back to the register not knowing what to do and informed her there was not a larger size of the coat or any dog clothes for that matter. I asked her what can I do?  She said very snappy \"well if you don't have a rewards card I'm not giving you a credit\" just about as rudely as she could say. At this point I was at the verge of tears, very embarrassed and also not feeling well as I'm a diabetic and I could feel my sugar getting low. She said I had to go and find something similar in price to switch out. Being that I make my own dog food and I have a dog that's allergic to grain I just picked up some dog treats and bones things that I really did not need and brought them to the register. As I was at the register I became a bit disoriented as I think my blood sugar became too low I started to sweat and just became a little confused, she then snapped at me and said you still have $5 credit I said to her \"well ma'am I'm not feeling well I feel like I'm having a diabetic problem and I really don't care about the $5\" she said that's fine and ended up putting that in a card. I never saw such a lack of respect towards a customer by someone who calls themself a supervisor and all of my life. She made me feel absolutely stupid for wanting to do an even return and never offered to even call or send me to another store to see if we could find the coat that I really wanted for my dog and just made me settle for some products I absolutely didn't want. The treats that I was forced to buy actually had grain in them and caused my dogs an allergic out break!! I called the corporate office to complain about the incident however I have not received a call back and it's been about 48 hours. I find it sad that store managers somehow forget these days that people are still given gifts and I don't think asking to exchange it for the same product that fits is asking her to go above and beyond anything that she would be capable of doing!! Her name was Angel and I would suggest if you're looking for a pet store that offers customer service in compassion this would not be the place for you to go. Although she was no way responsible for my blood sugar dropping the lack of humanity for her to even ask me if I was okay or would I like to sit down for a moment never even occurred to her. She was more interested in embarrassing me about the exchange without a receipt I was doing.", "date": "2017-01-25 10:10:02"}

I love hot pot and have been waiting for CLE to get a hotpot restaurant for some time (and am too lazy to buy the hot pot and all the ingredients myself, so having a restaurant is quite nice).\n\nIt's a large restaurant- one side is for the sushi/hibatchi and the other side is solely dedicated to hot pot. The tables have the electric burner in the middle as well as accommodating individual hot pots with individualized controls, etcera.\n\nThe waitress was Chinese and proceeded on speaking Mandarin to me the moment we sat down. haha. Luckily I can understand enough, but am pretty horrible on responding, so I just answered back in English- and the waitress switched to English for me. haha.\n\nWe did not follow the other yelp reviews and went for dinner instead. It's just hard to make it out to this area during lunch time (and seriously, who has TIME to leave work for lunch???!). Anyways, the dinner price is $24.95 (or $32.95 if you get the premium seafood stuffs) for all you can eat hot pot. So, come hungry. You'll have a time limit of 2 hours and if you waste food, they'll charge you by the pound (I mean, it makes sense, right? Just don't be wasteful!).\n\nThere are various soup bases to pick from- I always like having a mixed soup hot pot, so we got the sha cha flavor as well as the Sichuan spicy (which...was pretty spicy!). \n\nYou then proceed to look at the menu and write down on a piece of paper (kind of like dim sum style), what you want. There's a large assortment of meats (ranging from fatty lamb/beef, liver, stomach, chicken gizzard, etc), large assortment of seafood (crab, clam, mussels, fish fillets, etc), typical balls you cook in hot pot (various fish balls like cuttlefish or homemade fish balls, beef balls, etc), and other items like many different veggies, lotus root, fish tofu, wood ear, etc etc, the list is quite huge. To me, you don't even need to get the \"premium\" hot pot special, because just the general is fine.\n\nOff to the side, there's also a station where you can get various sauces and toppings to go with your food.\n\nWe got:\n- Fatty lamb\n- Fatty beef\n- Fuchow fish ball\n- Cuttlefish fish ball\n- Homemade fish ball\n- Fish Tofu\n- Wood Ear\n- Watercress\n\nAll were very good- I was impressed with the cuts of the fatty lamb and beef and our favorite was definitely the homemade fish ball and the fish tofu. We got second plates of those.\n\nOverall, I thought the hot pot was very good. I thought the soups could be a tad more flavorful (maybe I've been spoiled from hot pot restaurants in different cities), but for the quality and amount of food you get (I mean, it's all you can eat- it's practically a buffet), I thought it was good. I think it's probably a BETTER price and choice to come during lunch, but if you're busy working ppls like us, we don't have time for that! \n\nIf it's cold and you're craving some good warm healthy food, check out this hot pot place- and probably come for lunch to get the most bang for your buck (but I do think it's worth the dinner price- just come with a big appetite!).", "date": "2016-12-05 02:03:45"}

To help you effortlessly glide through the whole hot-pot experience, here's how:\n\n1. Come during week days lunch time\n    On weekends it is reported having to wait for 1 hour to get a seat.\n\n2. Get the $11 per person hot pot option.\n     You can get sushi anywhere else. You'll only get to experience fun hot pot experience here. in Cleveland area.\n\n3. Pick individual hot pot, or communal big pot\n     Individual pot: you cook your own, eat your own ingredients. Not sharing with dining partners. Communal big pot: aka family style. Your dining partners and yourself will collectively cook all your ingredients in the hot iron plate in the middle of the table, and share food.\n\n4. Eat person gets to pick 7 ingredients from the photo gallery menu\n     All ingredients come with pictures. No guess work here. I recommend seafood over meat, because you almost force them to present you with fresh seafood. The pre sliced meat however are all frozen...feels like frozen, packaged bulk meat you get from Costco.\n\n5. Pick your soup base\n     For non-spicy eaters, go with chicken broth option. Everything else is spicy.\n\n6. While waiting, visit the condiment stand, and concoct your own dipping sauce(s)\n\n7. Server brings the soup pot to the table, and turn on the heat for you\n     Make sure to learn how to control the temperature, so you can crank it up or turn it off later. (Shouldn't be difficult anyway)\n\n8. Cook away!", "date": "2016-11-22 19:31:59"}

The main future is certainly the expansive menu that surpasses the other sushi houses I have experienced. They have their special rolls that are in the names of Vehicle makes. I tried the BMW and Mercedes; outstanding flavor and was served quickly. The presentation was on spot. I wanted to try the lot of everything; as good as it is; I cannot afford $26 pp all you can eat that frequently. That being said it is worth the price. I ordered chicken tampora; teriyaki chicken; sweet potato roll, chicken roll, California Roll, Noodles, Edamame; and Chicken steak Hibachi. The hibachi was cooked to a great taste, serving size was incredibly fair; not too large as so you cannot enjoy anything else as Toko in Streetsboro/Kent really loads up on the fried rice (not that I am upset about a large serving). The hibachi does not cost extra either and is included in the buffet and is unlimited.  The sushi was very good; considerable to finer sushi houses I have been to around the country. There were 6 pieces to each roll and they were a little larger than I am used to which is also a plus to me. So many options that trying it all in a few trips would be a challenge.  The setting at Ridge Park Square at the old Hong Kong buffet is an interesting choice; however they have renovated the entire interior and it is stunning. I do want to try the hot pot in the near future. I went on a Wednesday and it was not that busy. However I am attributing that to it being a Wednesday and I was told during the weekend there could be a wait up to an hour which is really good to hear since this needs to stick around. The service was from an obvious trainee so it was okay but I got served by the manager more than the actual server; its not a big deal and they were not afraid to ask if you wanted more which was welcoming since you did not feel rushed.

The team does such a great job and everything looks wonderful, is well balanced and constructed, and is high quality.  This sushi is good not just compared to other AYCE or buffets, but it is good to other sushi places in NEO period. Great quality.  \n\nThe only part I don't care for is that the 'specialty rolls' tend to be a bit odd and are very similar to each other. I wish there was a little more variety here and a little less shrimp tempura + spicy mayo and eel sauce.  But!!

By that I mean, it's less authentic and more bland. And kids meal options that included chicken fingers and burgers (pet peeve of mine). Portion sizes are average, but certainly smaller than most other Mexican restaurants. \n\nNothing really stood out as \"wow have to come back!\" The ubiquitous chips were unsalted, and the salsa was just ok. Steak ranchero was pretty much bland tomato sauce over thinly sliced piece of steak. Rice was just rice. As in white rice without seasoning, hence no flavor. Refried beans were good. Was disappointed to receive flour tortillas (3) as opposed to corn ones. Guacamole salad was ok. \n\nWith the speed of everything coming out of the kitchen, I would have to suspect everything is premade and then run under a salamander (pro kitchen broiler). Not always a bad thing, just a note that probably explains the blandness of the food. Premade usually means unseasoned so they can be kept longer.\n\nPrices are in the $7-13 range for most things.

The sushi is fresh and tasty and most importantly plentiful. There is a wide array of different types of sushi from nigiri, handrolls, and regular rolls. Some of the specialty rolls are actually named after cars which is unique and a nice spin on things. They have red tuna sashimi when I went, which lots of AYCE sushi places don't have it and was happy when they did. I ordered tons of that.\n\nI would highly recommend Kintaro to anyone who loves sushi.

The restaurant is family-friendly, located out in a stripmall and filled with massive tables and booths.   But the garrish decor is not the only reason why you'll note this is not a fancy restaurant.  Nor is the troth of peanuts at the entrance. \nThe booth seats are deeply broken in, the chopsticks are cheap and will splinter, and the electric burner in the table won't heat evenly.  \n\nNevertheless, we enjoyed adding a dozen tasty meats, noodles, and veggies to our pot.  Be adventurous and try out some of the less familiar items.  Just be careful, it IS possible to create an unappetizing mess.  Be sure keep an eye on you additions as they take only a minute to cook through, especially the meats.   Remember that the sauces are for dipping. \n\nI would order these again: balls of fish (caution: they get very hot), taro, cabbage, black mushroom, lotus root, chinese lettuce, bean sprouts, tong hao cai, tofu skin, turnip, enoki, watercress, and wood ear.  \n\nI would definitely not reorder bamboo shoot (its from a can), the corn cob (popular, but too starchy), frozen tofu, or whole shrimp (not worth the mess of shelling them at the table).  Many of the items come to you frozen: clumps of noodles, seafood, and some vegetables with ice on them. It would be nice if they even went to the trouble to defrost them first!  Anywhere else it would be scandalous to serve frozen food where it was meant to be fresh, but at Kintaro that seems to be the norm.  \n\nLastly, the soup-base was very disappointing.  The six options are made of the same powdered mix, which is also available in crystallized form at the sauce station. \n\nI recommend eating here at least once, just be sure to keep your expectations reasonably low.", "date": "2018-02-07 06:07:50"}

I'm told the branch in North Royalton rocks, so maybe y'all should head over for a better experience.)\n\nAs a Mr. Hero virgin up till yesterday, I'll be generous.  The Romanburger, the signature menu item for the chain, is genuinely good. So good that it bumps up what would've been a 0.5 star review to a 3 star one.  Too much?  I'll leave others to bring it down--I haven't quite the heart to do it.\n\nFor fast food, the sandwiches here taste deceptively light.  The bread is lighter, fluffier, and much less dense than Subway's buns.  The amount of filler is also on the thin side--think, Wendy's-Jr.-Burger-thin, but if that burger were stretched to 7 or 10 inches.  Meals here can actually be light with a little portion control, which I like.  Half a 7\" Hot Buttered Cheesesteak and a third of the 10\" Romanburger, \"Waffer\" (waffle) fries with cheese dipping sauce filled me up just right.  (Ok, not exactly the smallest portion, but with a little bit more control, I could've done without one of the sandwiches).\n\nThe 10\" Romanburger (which can be ordered at less-intimidating lengths, ahem) features three, small, thin burger-esque \"Italian luncheon loaf\" patties as well as salami slices and swiss cheese on top of a bed of refreshing, vinegarette-tossed shredded lettuce, tomatoes, onions and mayonnaise.  The combination of the salami, loaf patties, lettuce and mayonnaise was exquisite.  The \"Waffer\" fries were crispy and surprisingly under-salted/seasoned, but perfect for dipping in the cheese sauce, which reminded me--no, tasted EXACTLY like Taco Bell/movie theater nacho cheese sauce.\n\nDespite its tantalizing name, my Hot Buttered Cheesesteak was not so impressive.  That it came with grilled onions, mushrooms and swiss--I liked.  But the steak, alas, bore no resemblance to anything I've encountered calling itself steak.  While the Romanburger patties could've passed for actual burger patties, the product developers over at Mr. Hero's clearly didn't even try to hide the fact that the \"steak\" was anything but.  Fluffy, air-injected, thin-cut slabs of spam-like lunchmeat, dyed brown that had no business crouching there between the buns of my cheesesteak sandwich, waiting to ambush me.  Aghast, I turned to my fellow diners.  Where was my beloved paper-thin slices of juicy ribeye that mixed so well with gobs of melted swiss?  \n\nCertainly nowhere to be found in this depressingly forlorn, shadow-filled dining room, its ugly, crumb-spattered carpeting and stickily stained formica tables not doing much for the only decor for the entire joint: color-faded closeups of glistening sandwiches and burgers that clearly COULDN'T be ordered off the menu.  The entire place had the dismal air of a neglected Ross/Kohl's/TJ Maxx/Marshall's fitting room or recently sanitized motel room after a crime scene.  Except not so clean.  No joke.\n\n(Some will claim that Mr. Hero bears a uniquely Cleveland taste and that the lunchmeat texture should be appreciated as such.  I call bull.)\n\nService was quick--but then again, we were the only ones there the first five minutes.  There were three workers behind the counter that we could see, yet the trash bins were overflowing.  I've worked in fast food before--there's no reason that should ever happen.  The rest of the dining room as before mentioned, was ill-lit and ill-kept.  \n\nIf I ever come back, it'll be for the Romanburger, and it'll be for takeout, thanks very much.  Hot Buttered Cheeesesteak, may we never see each other again.  (Penn Station, just across the parking lot, offers a Philadelphia Cheesesteak that's only, oh, 10,000,000,000 times superior.)  If you decide to dine there, just make sure you know what you're in for--or if you're too drunk to care.  Otherwise, sitting on the curb outside if the sun's out might actually make you feel better.", "date": "2011-07-10 00:26:45"}

Food came out fairly fast and I love they put the food in a ginormous plate. That way, there can be extra room on the table. As for the dipping sauce, you will head up to the sauce bar. And self-serve yourself with 10+ sauce and condiment to go with your food.\n\nEven though I didn't have a chance to try their sushi, I'm in love with Kintaro already. I wish they will open one in Columbus. Food is good and service is attentive. What can I ask for more in a restaurant?", "date": "2017-12-09 22:21:39"}

No question about that.  The price you get for AMC is stellar, they now offer you a slew of food options and alcoholic beverages.  This review has absolutely nothing to do with theaters itself.\n\nEvery time I go to Ridge Park I find myself annoyed by someone in the theater.  The last time was our fault.  The lady wanted to see the new J-Lo flick \"The Boy Next Door\" and we were in a theater of teens who just turned 17 or 18 and talked during the whole movie, checked their phones and texted, and were just disrupted.  \n\nAMC stationed workers at the door to make sure underagers didn't make it into the theater, but I'm surprised they discontinued the practice of ushers walking around the theater.  Rarely does the walk-around do anything, but it's nice to know there's a presence.  Especially because it's a prime locale if you're of the impression of getting frisky in a darkened theater.\n\nThere's been two other films that I've seen here with someone that doesn't know general ethics of being a movie theater patron.\n\nIn Los Angeles, some theaters have ushers introduce themselves before the show, and let you know they'll be around if you need anything or want to complain.  This would probably be a good practice with AMC that only has 6 theaters in the building.  Especially with this location.", "date": "2015-02-06 22:41:02"}

I went here based on the reviews and the pic as well. Soon as you walk in the hostess tells you about the all you can eat sushi buffet which is $25.99 per person or you can get seated with the regular menu. I decided to get the sushi buffet since I was very hungry and in the mood for sushi. Once seated the waiter brings out the menu and explains the rules. You can order as much appetizers as you want and the hibachi's as well without any charge. The sushi you order has to be mostly eaten but you can leave a few pieces out. They charge you $10.99/lb for food waste and whatever they charge you are able to take home. I started out with the dumplings, edamame, and spring rolls. The edamame was bland and it was very furry which was very unusual for me. The dumplings were okay but the spring rolls were very delicious. Once finished with that I ordered the Mercedes Benz, Lobster and California. The lobster was very delicious, but the Mercedes Benz was okay. They do give you about 12 rolls or so for the speciality rolls and for the classic rolls they give you 6. So be prepared to expect more on the specialty rolls. Since I was quite full I decided to order the udon beef noodles as well and the chicken and shrimp hibachi. The udon beef noodles were thick and the broth was very flavorful. The hibachi was amazing as well! Overall I got full off the all you can eat sushi buffet and as well as ordered a lot. The sushi portion gives you a lot but the flavor in the sushi wasn't as good as i thought. I think the price is little pricy but the food quality is really good. I would defiantly come back here for the food but maybe not for the buffet.", "date": "2017-05-04 00:50:18"}

No complaints.\n\nThe price: $15 for lunch for all you can eat for sushi and other common Japanese food is a good value for most (great, if you can eat many rolls).\n\nThe food: Overall, the sushi was ok. There was nothing wrong with it, but it's just decent. Very similar in quality to the normal suburban strip mall joints. I do like that it is made to order and not just stilling on a buffet table. The tuna/avo hand roll was the best item I tried. The tempura shrimp was bland and overly battered.

I would recommend going for lunch unless you can really eat a lot, as the 7 items included for lunch is about as much as I can eat anyway. The Sichuan broth is great! Chicken broth was a bit bland. There's also a little make-your-own sauce bar that I appreciated. We also had a beautiful sushi boat because my father accidentally ordered too many rolls. The sashimi was fresh and delicious.

When you walk in, the host will ask if you've been there before, and I believe this drives your service assignment because the first visit was the best as far as service went.  The second time, the server was a bit lazy and I had to go hunting in order to get some forks, and the check, for example.  The third time, the young lady assigned to us was very sweet but (1) did not bring any kind of plate to rest hot pot ladles on, (2) provided nothing to put empty clam shells in, and (3) looked at me like I was the man in the moon when I asked for a soup bowl.  Seeing as a common way to end a hot pot meal is to cook your noodles and eat them with your broth, as a soup, this was not an unreasonable request.  Also, I had made the rookie error of forgetting to break up my ramen noodles before cooking them, so I needed some extra help.  She did eventually bring a small bowl, at least bigger than the little condiment bowls that were initially offered.\n\nLet me reassure you that fear of average service is no reason to stay away from Kintaro.  It is an amazing place.  If you are new to hot pot, read up a little about how it is done, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.\n\nThis being my third hot pot meal, I was much more relaxed than earlier visits.  I went with Szechuan broth today, because I love spicy Asian food, and with all seafood and low carb vegetables in order to minimize the toll on my post-holiday diet.  I had fish filets, cilantro balls (which are fish based), marvelous little clams, squid, a bunch of cilantro (which was great with this broth as a soup green), bean sprouts, Enoki mushrooms, black mushrooms, and ramen noodles.  I wish that they would put udon noodles on the lunch menu.  While waiting for the food to arrive, I made my own sauce of sesame oil, soy sauce, garlic, and green onions.  I also got some Kintaro sauce, which was great and would work as an only condiment.  I did much better at managing my broth this time than earlier visits, just kicking up the heat a little when adding food, then reducing to a simmer as soon as it started boiling.  I didn't have to have any liquid added, which helped maintain the flavor of my broth.\n\nMy sushi-eating wife loved the fish filets (as did I) and helped me with them, and I helped her with her sushi.  Sharing is much of the fun.  So I ordered more filets, along with Fuchow fish balls.  I found the Fuchow fish balls a little tough, which may have been operator error on my part.  I preferred the cilantro balls and the homemade fish balls, which I have had on other visits.  Some of the clams had full digestive tracts and so were a bit gritty.  This is not really a complaint as some people like them that way, a la A. Zimmern.  Just an FYI.\n\nAfter eating everything but a smattering of vegetables, I made a soup of them with the noodles and some of the broth, which was delicious.\n\nI felt like I got good value at $14.99 for lunch, and I feel that $24.99 would be okay for dinner with the expanded menu.\n\nSo, a slight downgrade for service, which I think is management's best opportunity to improve the business.  Kintaro is a must-visit if you love Asian food!  I went on about hot pot but the sushi and hibachi choices are very good as well.", "date": "2018-01-26 17:33:31"}

I live my pho and my boiled greens with pork but I just can't get into hot pot. With that said, I came here for the sushi so stop with what you're thinking in your head.\n\nMy cousin came into town so on his last night, we came here before he left for home. Some of the other guys in the party had already been here but this was my first. There were 8 of so we got 4 hot pots and 4 sushi so we could all enjoy it without them having to watch over us and us having to watch over our shoulders. It worked out great. I don't know if they offer anything else besides the \"buffet\" deal but it's gotta suck being the sushi chefs at a \"buffet\" place like this. The hot pot menu is pretty vast from what I saw. The sushi menu is pretty standard fare, as I would expect. Selection wise was a lot better than I had expected though. You get to choose from sashimi, nigiri, hand rolls, and rolls. They even offer Hibachi dinners you can order. The portion on that is rather small but it's fine as it's a all you can eat. Overall, I was pretty impressed but I don't know if I ate my money's worth. I only ordered sushi and it took forever to come out. While waiting, I ate some boiled meats since I was hella hungry.\n\nWould I come back? Maybe. I'm coming from Akron so it's a long drive after pigging out. I was told there's actually a 2hr time limit for customers but with how long it takes for sushi to come out, I would hate to get booted because of the time limit and more than half of it was spent waiting for my food. Again, we came in a SLOW weekday night and we waited a bit. I can't imagine the wait on a busy day.", "date": "2018-03-10 00:23:29"}

Omg how to choose?  We ordered the edename appetizer and several sushi rolls to share.  Wow I was surprised with the quality and freshness of the sushi!  Definitely the best I have had since moving to Cleveland!

It's a bit hard to describe the taste of Sha Cha but it's savory. Note, it does look like you can get individual pots if you don't want to do a large communal one. \nWe then proceeded to get double the meat - the fatty beef and the pork slices. We also got double the Fuchow fish balls and the Homemade fish balls. One has a a filling, I believe it's the Fuchow, and I much preferred that one. We also got chinese cabbage, all of the mushrooms, fried tofu, cilantro, tofu skin, potatoes, watercress, rice noodles and potato vermicelli. I thought the amoung of meat didn't seem to be much but when eating everything you definitely don't feel hungry. But if you're a big meat eater you may have to order more. \n\nHelpful Tips\n-Wait for the pot to boil.\n-Put in the things that cook longer (ex: potatoes, melon, corn, etc.) and also put in the mushrooms - that'll give the broth extra flavor.\n-There's a sauce station where you can make your own sauce mix - don't be scared to experiment, it can turn out delicious! I did that for one of my sauces. The other I stuck with the pretty traditional sauce combo - sesame mixed with the chives mixture (it looks kind of gross but I promise it's delicious). I departed a bit from the basic mixture by adding garlic because you can't go wrong with garlic.\n-They have raw eggs at the sauce station as well - they're delicious in the hot pot! Put them in to get them hardboiled, crack them into a spoon and poach them. I'm partial to poaching them since you get the flavor of the broth as well!\n\nOverall Thoughts\nI'd give this place a 4.5. The only reason it's not a 5 is that I wish their meat selection was larger - different cuts, some innards, etc. I definitely recommend this for lunch with friends but it's definitely not something to rush through. If you only have an hour - I'd say come back when you have a bit more time. The service was fast but you're cooking this yourself and you can only cook and eat so fast. The place was very clean and well decorated. I also think I'd strictly come here for lunch, $14.99 is a great price for everything you get but the dinner price seems to be a bit expensive unless the selection is a lot bigger and there's dinner-specific food you want to try.", "date": "2017-10-09 01:50:33"}

Our server helped explain how the ordering worked - pick your broth, pick your noodle option, and then pick your meat, seafood and vegetables. Once you place your order they will bring out some pickled cucumbers and tomato and some peanuts to snack on before your hot pot arrives.  Most people around opted for the shared pot in the center of the table with split broth, unfortunately my dining partner was allergic to fish so we opted to two separate pots.  There are many options in the sauce bar to make a customized dipping sauce.  Unbeknownst to me beforehand, you really don't drink the broth - it's similar to fondu, it's just a vessel to cook your meats and veggies inside.  The Shacha broth was nicer than the chicken broth but I'd like to try Szechuan next time.  I would say to skip the noodles, too filling.  The meats were very thinly sliced and slightly frozen, which is to be expected given the thinness of the slice.  The crab was good as well, the shrimp balls were just okay, and the pork balls I didn't particular like.  I would like to try the fish balls next time.  Bok choy and Chinese cabbage are a great filling addition, you can also get lettuce to make little wraps with the meats.\n\nDuring dinner you can order as many items and as many times as you want, two things to remember you have a 2 hour time limit and there is a 10% charge per pound of waste. I will definitely be back to try the lunch portion since I found dinner a little too pricey for the amount of food I was actually able to consume, which wasn't much since after one plate that included noodles I was pretty full.", "date": "2017-03-24 23:14:23"}

The restaurant was moderately filled, but the restaurant itself is huge so it didn't feel crowded. \n\nThe server and manager were very pleasant and nice. It was our first time trying Chinese Hot Pot so we had a few questions for the server and she was quite helpful. \nThey give you a paper menu that you can write what you want / how many you want for the Sushi and a blank piece of paper to write down the numbers of your selection for the hot pot. \n\nWe chose Chicken Broth / Chinese Herb for 1 pot and Sha Cha / Chinese Herb for the other. \nI've only had the Koreanized version of hot pot / shabu shabu in Korea before so I wasn't sure what to select to put in.. But despite that, the soups turned out quite well. I would totally utilize the sauce station next time and add some more seasoning since some of the soup bases can be a little on the bland side. \n\nThe sushi took a bit longer since it was made to order. When the sushi platter arrived, we were really pleasantly surprised at the quality. The sashimi was thick, larger cut and fresh. The nigiri sushi had a good fish to rice ratio and the rice was cooked well. Not too mushy or undercooked. Looking back on it, you can probably get additional soy sauce for dipping at the sauce station but the server was kind enough to get them for us as we weren't aware of it. \nAll of the rolls ordered were AWESOME. So much better than your usual buffet fare and I'd even go as far as saying it was better than some Japanese restaurants around here. \n\nThe hibachi and tempura items were also very good and since some of the guests didn't like raw sushi, it was nice that they had salads, hibachi, fried rice and noodle dishes available in the menu. They even had low-carb options for the sushi and sashimi is always a good option so I wouldn't hesitate to visit even when I go back to my usual low-carb diet. \nIce cream was really good as well, and the bubble tea was delicious too (according to the guest who ordered it. I didn't try it myself). \nThey give you slices of oranges for dessert at the end. \n\nThe server was very attentive, asked if we wanted to order more and we didn't feel like (unlike some other all-you-can-eat made to order places) that we weren't welcome to order more. \n\nOverall, \nFood was 5/5 \nService was 5/5 \nAtmosphere was 4.5/5 (The floor was super slippery - I was practically skating on it) \n\nThey offer lunch options that are cheaper on Saturdays too, so we're planning on trying that as well. :) Hopefully they keep this up. :D", "date": "2017-08-28 15:02:22"}

As mentioned in previous reviews the owners are friendly and care about thier customers.

We were encouraged to order the turkey reuben it was promised to be \"fantastic\". I noticed the menu stated cole slaw instead of saurekraut, just assumed it would be german cole slaw, caroway seeds without mayo...silly me. I also assumed the sandwich would be served on rye, instead of a tasteless whitebread. They used the reuben cooking method buttered the bread and put it on the grill. So the whitebread soaked up the butter and the heated slaw mayo melted converted the sandwich into greasebomb. I just wrote it off as a creative reuben experiment that went bad. But what was inexcusable were the undercooked french fries. It was obvious the fryer wasn't hot enough the turned soggy and soaked. I did mention to the waitress the fries were unedible and suggested they turn up the heat on fryer.\nI'm hoping my poor experience was due to inconsistancy and not incompetence.

We wrote the number down nice and clear, even separated it out meat, seafoods, balls and veggies. We put down beef, lamb and pork stomach.. but then when the server brought out the plate of protein, there were liver and kidney on it. All the veggies were messed up and missing mushroom. So entire order we wrote down I don't even know if they even look at it or just threw stuff on there whatever. I know it's buffet place... but you guys brought stuff out that we can't even eat like pork liver and stuff? Then you gonna charge extra fine $10 per lbs if we didn't finish the food? How is that make any sense? Please at least the people in the back should remember all the numbers so won't mess up people orders.\nAlso the most grossed me out was on the instant noodle they brought out to us, there was mold on it!

I've been over-paying for mediocre movie experiences until one magical day...\n\nThat day was about a month in a half ago when the most handsome guy schooled me on what a theater experience should be. From the ticket purchasing process, the concession counter and bar, to the comfortable, recliners you sit in--holy ish. How did I not know about this?! \n\nThis is coming from a gal who had actually been to this theater before, but years ago when it was still just a cruddy, below-average place. Sticky floors, outdated equipment and the usual concession snacks. What it is now is a complete 180 from even the \"better\" theaters I thought I was visiting locally. **Cough, Valley View, cough, cough** Honestly, I'd even skip Crocker Park. \n\nNow back to the details. You don't have to wait in line to grab a ticket. Nope! Just head to one of the many kiosks to grab your assigned seats. Yep--you get to pick your seats! But don't worry if you have to sit right next to strangers, the recliners are huge and there's ample space between patrons. Another pro-tip: popular movies and/or popular movie-going nights call for pre-ordered tickets. Don't say I didn't warn you! \n\nCan we talk about the full bar? I didn't partake the first time around, but I'll certainly be taking advantage from now on. They also offer up traditional snacks and \"movie foods\" with a few extra specialities you wouldn't expect. \n\nAnd then, you sit down. YES. So much yes. This is pretty much what a theater/movie experience should have been all along. So glad AMC caught on (finally).", "date": "2014-06-27 17:46:46"}

I've had better spicy tuna roll from Giant Eagle in the evening, if that tells you anything. Shrimp tempura roll was just ok; nothing to write home about.

Kintaro offers authentic eats, with nice decor, good service, a quality environment, and a large space. My boyfriend and I have been here twice for dinner AYCE hotpot. The restaurant is a great go-to when you're hungry, craving Asian food, and not willing to bother with long wait times.\n\nFirstly, the ingredients are fresh and the fishballs were surprisingly high quality. Wow that Fuchow Fish Ball (\u798f\u5dde\u9b5a\u4e38; for those unfamiliar, it is a fish ball filled with pork). I have not had such fresh Fuchow fish balls before with such delicious flavor! The portions are also very generous. I've had their fatty beef, and while I personally prefer my beef to be thinner, it is good quality for AYCE.\n\nI've gotten the chicken broth both times and it has been absolutely light, with just enough taste. As a nice plus, my chicken broth came with some Chinese herbs like goji berries (the orange-ish raisin-like fruit) and red dates (the sweet, wrinkled looking fruit) to add some additional flavor and nutrition. My boyfriend had the Sichuan Spicy soup base. This is not spice to mess around with. Sichuan spice emphasizes a numbing heat rather than the usual spicy heat others may be used to. Unless you are familiar with the spice, I would recommend trying something else, or mixing it with another base if possible. It is also a bit on the oily side, which may be upsetting to some stomachs.\n\nThe service is great, though admittedly hit or miss. Our first time, we had a younger waitress who did not walk us through how to order (we needed to ask), and she was not as attentive or helpful with our food. Our second visit was absolutely phenomenal, with Joanne as our waitress. She came over constantly asking us if we wanted to order more food, refilled our pots, and provided us with plates and switched them since my boyfriend had shellfish.\n\nI was also super happy that there is a sauce station (YAY) with plenty of options where you can get eggs and other delicious condiments to accompany your hotpot.\n\nOverall.. for its price, the environment, and the unique offering of such delicious hotpot, my boyfriend and I are very happy to have found a key restaurant to frequent and return to! The only \"downside\"? It's AYCE and they serve delicious ice cream at the end (ask for it, if they forgot to offer it to you), so I will need to watch my weight.\n\nFor newtimers:\n- Write your orders down (you can write the number) on separate paper [not the menu]; you can indicate serving size next to each (for example, 1/2 serving, 2 servings)\n-  You can ask for individual hotpot bowls, or have hotpot in the center to share with the group (up to two types of broth) -- Remember, you will be sharing a broth with others, so if you don't like some flavors your friends have ordered (e.g., tong hao cai or lamb), it may be worthwhile (though maybe less fun) to stick to your own\n- In my opinion, the service was fast enough where you could separate your order out (especially since they are raw ingredients); if you are not familiar with the serving size, and you tend to eat less, I recommend starting conservatively with 2 meat servings and 4 or so other additions. I've ordered 2 servings of beef and 6 additions .. and have been overly full each time; I may order half servings instead at my next visit so I can still have more options (we were a party of two- is less of an issue with more friends)\n\nFor people new to hotpot overall:\n- Chinese hotpot is usually eaten during the cold seasons, and is a way for groups to gather and share food around a hot pot to keep warm\n- Condiments: At home, I've had shacha sauce (soybean oil, garlic, dried shrimp, fish), which tastes like BBQ sauce, and some people will mix this with raw egg or peanut butter. The world is your oyster and there are plenty of condiments to choose from, so experiment! The dumpling sauce (vinegar and soy sauce) with sacha and green onion was delish\n- Usually, people will put in vegetables (especially the ones requiring longer cooking times) first, and cook meat individually. Use the soup ladle with holes to hold your meat and watch it to prevent overcooking. Beef is easier and faster to cook (you can get away with some redness), but make sure you cook other meats like fish, chicken and pork well\n- Hotpot is HOT- blow well or your tongue will get burned\n- Remember hotpot etiquette if you're sharing: pull the food you put in out, and cook with your ladle (try not to use chopsticks with uncooked meat)\n- At the start of hotpot, people usually dip their cooked meat in condiments; you can ask for an extra bowl (or take one from the sauce station) for a separate soup bowl. People usually have their soup (with or without noodles) at the end since the broth will have all the flavors from the meal at this time; it is also less salty since additional water was added\n- For ingredients, I like: fatty beef, Fuchow fish ball, fish tofu, spinach, and udon noodles", "date": "2017-02-05 18:34:11"}

I've been here a couple times and each visit I have been wowed! At first it is a little intimidating (especially if you have never tried hotpot) but if you need any guidance just look around and watch the other diners.  It's kind of like Asian fondue.  First, you get to choose your broth (I get the Szechuan broth because I like my foods spicy,  however there are non spicy broths to choose from).  Next, you choose 7 different items from the menu they give you.  My last visit, I  got the fatty beef, cilantro lime fishballs, squid, fish filet, Enoki mushrooms, dumplings and some kind of Chinese green I can't pronounce.  They serve all of these items on a big platter where you cook them in the broth.  There's a condiment bar near the hot pot tables where you concoct your perfect dipping sauce or sauces for your meats/veggies.  I personally like to mix sesame oil. salt and a little siracha topped with scallions and cilantro. I usually do this after ordering.  If you come during lunch, it's only $10.99, even on a Saturday!  With that said, you might have to wait at least 30 minutes to an hour for a hot pot table.  It's pretty popular especially on Saturdays.  Good news is that they take reservations so you don't have to be surprised when you show up and have to wait forever.  One last thing, make sure you come hungry!", "date": "2017-01-10 16:18:28"}

A free standing building in front of Lowes, you would never know that this was recently a Chinese Buffet; they have remodeled the place to look very Asian modern, lots of browns and tans with tiles.  The overall effect is upscale and cool with a nice bit of class.  \n\nWhile Kintaro has several all you can eat options, it is not a buffet, rather you are served at your table.  I've tried Kintaro several times for the weekday lunch $14.99 all you can eat Sushi and Hibachi.  You are given a single page menu which you check off what you want.  There are a couple of limitations: you eat all of what you order; they will not modify any items and they will limit how much you get at a single time.\n\nI tried a bunch of apps and other hot items, including the teriaki squid, the hibachi shrimp, the spring rolls, shumei and fried squid app.   The Shumei and squid app were both nice and relatively small, nothing special, but nice and the right size so that you are not filled up.  The Teriaki Squid was a larger portion of squid with peppers, onions and brocolli in a decent sauce; the portion size was a bit too big for this type of dining, it will limit how many other items you can try.   The Hibachi  shrimp was a more reasonable size, with a side of fried rice and a nice creamy sauce.  Overall the hot foods are good and well made, but nothing really special.\n\nI have tried quite a number of the sushi items, Nigiri, small rolls and larger rolls.  The sushi menu has actually expanded a bit with them adding a number of items including more types of nigiri sushi.  The sushi was better then the buffets, not as good as the fine Sushi places around town, but good.  The rice to fish ratio is ok, I would prefer a bit less rice but I understand why it probably will not change.  The fish that is used is of good quality.   I was more impressed with the nigiri sushi which tends to showcase the quality of the fish being served, with the Tuna, White Tuna and Smoke Salmon all being very good.  The regular rolls are good, although I would wish that the spicy rolls were a bit spicier.   The large rolls are interesting, but tend towards using tempura frying and sauces to add flavors, rather then letting the flavors of the fish come through.  \n  \nDuring my first visit, I had a big issue with service, which was extremely slow, a huge problem when you are doing all you can eat table service.  In addition I did not get all of the items that I ordered each time.  I did talk to the manager who told me that they were short of servers , but even so I was sadly disappointed with the server I had.   On the later trips, they seem to have resolved these issues, with service being much better, with food coming out in a more timely manner.  I also limited the number of items I ordered at a single time so there was no issue with with missing items.\n\nA couple of other notes, all beverages are an additional charge, there are a number of other options available from the all you can eat menu.  There are hot pot options at lunch and dinner.  The sushi options have grown, you will not find anything very exotic here such as soft shell crabs, uni, scallops and the like, which I would love for them to add, but those are expensive items so I understand why they are not on the menu.\n\nThe improvements in service, have made Kintaro an excellent option for all you can eat sushi, especially at lunch when you have plenty of time.  Although not cheap you get high quality sushi and other Asian cuisine with good variety.   I have also heard that the hotpot option is very popular, so I will have to give that a try.", "date": "2016-11-08 23:55:36"}

I ordered a chorizo, steak, and an al pastor taco.  The al pastor was definitely my favorite and then it was the chorizo and then the steak.  The reason why I liked the al pastor the most is because it had more flavor packed into every bite compared to the other two.  \n\nMy husband, friend, and I sat at the bar and we got service right away.  Our drinks were served promptly (probably within 5 minutes from when we first sat down) and our tacos were served nice and hot in 10 minutes.  I looked at other reviews and I read a lot of horrible service reviews which was kind of upsetting so I needed to justify it myself.  The place wasn't too busy at 7pm in a Tuesday.  The restaurant is fairly new so I expected the service and food not to be perfect which blew me out of the water when it was.\n\nThey have a nice selection of tequila which goes perfectly with my variety of tacos.  The bartenders were very attentive to my needs.  They also have spicy salsa available for your tacos if you would like that gives your taste buds a kick.\n\nHonestly I'm not so sure how things would be if it got busy, but expect to wait a little longer because this food is definitely worth the wait.

My wife ordered 3 ala carte chicken enchiladas which had a small amount of salsa verde and she asked for a little more.

I ordered the chicken wing appetizer and received an extra one dollar charge for having the poblano sauce which the menu says it comes with it. When I told the server these extra charges are not on the menu she did not say anything. Your checkout receipt is a non itemized strip of adding machine tape, so it is hard to see what is what . On our first trip here they did not clear the machine and we had a huge bill with someone elses' charges on it which had to be sorted out and redone. Caveat emptor. Service was very good on both visits. As to the food it was average (guac,tacos ,enchiladas) to poor (chile con queso, fried beans and the rice). The chicken wings were very good the first time and way overcooked and dried out the second time.

This lunchtime meal was worth the trek out to Brooklyn from Cleveland Heights. Kintaro was much more suave than I was expecting from outside appearances, with modern stone finishes and ambient lighting. Even the bathrooms were clean, spacious, and freshly perfumed. A little overboard on the cheesy \"Chinese\" decorations, but hey, they've got to sell their niche, I suppose. \n\nThe entire space is separated into two dining areas and a sushi bar, with hot pot tables of varying sizes at the far end. These special stone-top tables have built-in conductive heaters - meaning that they'll heat only the pot and will feel cool to the touch. This sorcery does not extend to the pot and soup itself though, so don't be deceived and be sure to blow on your food before eating it! You can control the boiling intensity using the dials on the side of the table, or directly on the table for communal stovetops.\n\nWe were a little confused by the hot pot pricing, but here's what it boiled (hehe) down to: $25 all-you-can-eat (AYCE), all day, or $10.99 for the lunch special, which gives you a choice of soup base + 7 menu items (with no duplicates, so no double fatty beef, and noodles do count as 1 item). We were given little slips of paper to write down our orders for the lunchtime special, and then in short order our pots of soup base came out and were set in our individual inlaid stovetops. The ladles were long enough so that they wouldn't drown in the pots when left alone - hurrah! We got up to fill up on sauces at the self-serve station. There's a solid selection of traditional spices used, feel free to mix and match in different bowls! TIP: I also got a separate bowl of green onion and cilantro to throw into my soup, and some lemons for my water. \n\nIn not so short order (probably 20 minutes later, as they brought out all our party's orders at once), we were presented with individual plates of the raw hot pot items. To our very pleasant surprise, the meat/fish balls were handmade in-house! Instant credibility boost. The slices of meat were also very high quality, perfectly fatty and not too thin or frozen like some other CA Bay Area chains I've been to. Each of the 7 items was given in ample quantity and I believe for most people the lunchtime deal would leave you satisfyingly sated. Few in our party would have been able to eat more than 2x this quantity to get to make the AYCE deal worth it. \n\nBesides the actual delivery of food, the staff kept busy refilling our water glasses and restocking the soup broth, which is my main sticking point at hot pot places. So good on them! Even though it was pretty busy as a Saturday midday, we felt everything was in reasonable order and had a satisfying diner experience. \n\nOur sole mission here was to consume Chinese-style hot pot, so we didn't touch the sushi. From other friends who did taste it, the verdict was \"decent\". What would you expect for AYCE though?", "date": "2017-01-25 01:20:52"}

Upon entering the theater (Theater 6), we were able to find our seats immediately and seated ourselves, which was fine. We sat in the \"B\" row and our seats were very comfortable, as always.

As we watched intently, throughout the early movie reviews, everything seemed fine up to this point. It wasn't until the lights were turned off and the main attraction came on, is when things began to go south. Someone behind the scenes, turned the air conditioner on and boy, we were freezing! Yikes! My sister and niece had got up after the first thirty (30) minutes to actually find someone to alleviate the frigid theater temperature, to no avail. The area as to where you could speak with someone was surprisingly, closed off. Thus, made it impossible to pass on or actually reach out to someone to express your issues. After walking from \"the back\" of the theater to the front, where we were sitting, is when we clearly had second thoughts regarding our seating arrangements. Understanding that these are \"assigned\" seats, we opted to \"stay put\" to grin and bear it! Thee worst decision I can assure you! Needless to say, the whole family froze on Christmas day at the AMC Theaters and unfortunately, the movie was disappointing too. Dear AMC and/or to whomever reads this review, please be advised that the people in \"the front\" of the movie theater, need heat just as much as the patrons seated in the back.

They have pretty much anything you'd want to compliment your hotpot: tons of greens, noodle options, different types of meat and fishballs, root vegetables, thinly sliced meat, seafood, etc. They have four broths to choose from: Szechuan, Chinese herb, Shacha (a satay style base), and chicken broth. Our group ended up trying out the Szechuan and the Chinese herb. Personally, I wasn't so impressed with the Szechuan; it tasted really one note with a high level of spiciness but almost no flavor. The Chinese herb however was really good; it was a good balance of light and flavorful, while still allowing you to enjoy the flavor of the add-ons. They also do have the mix your own sauce bar, so you can pick and choose different sauces to compliment your hotpot items. \n\nI was surprised to find that Kintaro has really improved upon the space which was formerly Hong Kong King Buffet. The setup is largely the same, quite spread out and open, but they've added more high end decor, and of course the installed table burners for the hotpot. The service though was sort of hit or miss; the servers didn't take the best initiative to make sure our hotpot was filled, nor did he check back often for refills. Given that the customer is paying $25 for the all you can eat experience, I do think this is an important component, and I wish they'd do a better job of preparing their staff to anticipate the guests needs. There is a small upcharge if you don't finish what you order (I believe 10%) which is pretty fair. However, I feel like they purposefully don't really bring you as much as you order, which is sort of annoying. If the guests weren't being charged for extras, I could understand, but given that upcharge, they really should bring everything the guests order. I didn't try the sushi on this visit, but that's largely because I rarely care for AYCE sushi... to each his own I suppose. The rest of the hotpot add-ons were pretty much on point though; I love how much they had to choose from, and while it isn't the most high quality cuts of meat, I don't think detracts from the experience since Kintaro is more about quantity over quality. I feel like $25 is pretty standard for this type of AYCE, but I would definitely try to come back during lunch when they offer the same deal for just $11. Given there really isn't any comparable hotpot restaurant in the Cleveland area, I think this place satisfies, and it's definitely worth a try, especially if you've never had hotpot before.", "date": "2017-01-12 18:24:22"}

The meat had relatively no taste to it as if it were completely unseasoned before cooking and it was medium, not \"still mooing\" medium rare as I requested. \n\nMy companion had wings, the firecracker sauce. He said they were okay but as I've mentioned in other reviews, he pretty much eats anything so his reviews aren't quite as discerning. \n\nAs I initially wrote, maybe if I'd went here with a bunch of people to drink Irish beer and eat Irish food, I'd have had a better experience so Yelp readers, if that's what you're after, your mileage may vary. \n\nService was okay, though one waitress was in tight NIKE yoga pants which last I checked weren't really for work.\n\nAlso something funny that happened here - I flipped open the lid to the ketchup and without my even squeezing it, holding it upright, it starts squirting out and goes into my palm and all down my arm. I'm not sure if it was filled too fully or what, but I've never that that happen before, lol.", "date": "2018-02-02 02:23:49"}

We went to Texas Roadhouse twice in  two weeks.  My boyfriend, myself and a friend went, we all had the onion blossom , pretty good, the fried pickles we're better then expected and of course a few beers and stawberry banana margarita, can't go wrong with any of those. We all had the huge Tbone steak, salads and potato. Everything tasted great and I was super thrilled for my first time there. A week later we went back a took my brother, same deal same food, good stuff!\n\n Now for the bad. The fist visit my bf and his friend felt miserable and spent forever in the bathroom. I know its gross but unless you want the same experience, I'd keep this review in mind. So after being miserable the day after we chalked it up to over eating. 2nd visit, all 3 of us same thing all over again. This time had nothing to do with over eating because we left more then a little on our plates. Everything seemed to taste fine, so I can't rule out any one part of the meal that caused it. All 3 steaks were cooked at different temperatures, we each had a different type of potato and only 2 out of the 3 of us had Caesar salad. We shared the baby blossom which we also did the 1st time, so maybe that was it. Not for sure.\n\nSo as far as my review goes, the food tasted fantastic, but I've never felt worse after eating. I really wish it was just a fluke because I was so psyched about this place. :(", "date": "2011-10-28 23:55:29"}

It's a loud, excessive, over-the-top contributor to the nation's obesity epidemic. These are also some of the reasons that it's so damn popular. Using a sort of Texas meets commercial country/wild west theme, Texas Roadhouse is a decent place to get a good steak without having to take out a loan first.\n\nWe arrived around 5pm on a Sunday and the place was packed. People were spilling out of the waiting area and into the lobby, the hostess was doing her best to take names and pass out little electronic buzzing things, and the giant moose head hanging over the entrance looked on with cunning apathy. This place is not for those with a fear of loud noises and crowds. The decor is a combination of neon beer signs, steer horns, knotty pine planks, and cowboy. I was a tad unnerved by the giant mural of a Native American that took up most of the wall next to me. Disturbingly ironic.\n\nWe waited about 10 minutes before being ushered past the meat display case by the roll-carrying, black-shirted escort. The staff here is mostly female with an average age of about 19 and they're always moving. Unfortunately we got a two-top stuck right out in the middle of the floor. It had the same problems that all two-tops have in restaurants including lack of space (due mostly to the big metal pail of peanuts, salt and pepper shakers, menus, and steak sauce) and poor placement (I was constantly getting bumped into as servers whisked by to deliver food to the surrounding tables) but I was hungry and I was seated so I sucked it up.\n\nThe first of what would turn out to be three servers we'd have throughout our meal - apparently they've got a team approach to service - stopped by after a few minutes and took our drink order. Now for some notable highlights/lowlights:\n\nVery limited beer selection - First, there's no Shiner Bock or Texas beer of any kind and the rest of the beer offering reads like a frat house mini fridge. Luckily they had the good ole Cleveland staple Dortumunder Gold and a surprisingly tasty Leinenkugel Snowdrift vanilla porter. Chilled mugs, ugh. Chilled mugs are for floats not beer. They also offer a \"short\" and \"Tall\" option. I went with the short and would highly doubt they were more than 10oz pours for which I was charged what most bars charge for a full pint. Anyway, I had low expectations on this front and they were met.\n\nGood value-priced steaks - On par with the likes of Longhorn and Outback, the cow prices here are comfortably affordable and intended for the masses. I got a 12oz ribeye for $17 and it came with two sides. Not a bad deal considering I got dinner for the next day out of it, too. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, marked and seasoned well, and slathered in butter. The loaded baked potato and green beans did their best to stop my heart on the spot.\n\nAlternatives for those into swine - If steak isn't your thing you can get ribs, chicken and even fried catfish. My wife opted for the pulled pork and it was pretty damn tasty. Not covered in sauce the meat was tender and juicy with just a hint of smoke. It definitely reminded me of the BBQ we grew to love when we lived in Texas.\n\nThe rolls, my God, the rolls - These things, which are available in a seemingly endless supply, are fantastic. They're yeasty, sweet, buttery carb grenades that come served with a sugary, cinnamon butter. Make sure you get a basket to take home with you. These things would be great as buns for pulled pork sliders.\n\nIt's loud and it's country - I personally can't stand country music of any kind so I had to go to my happy place while I was here.  It's blasting out of every crevice of the restaurant and there's no escaping it. Luckily the steak I was noshing on was there to take my mind off of the audible assault.\n\nManic, Ooompah Loompah staff - It felt like there were about a hundred staff members running around the place, their black t-shirts emblazoned with \"I Love My Job\" melting into smears down the narrow aisles. They talk very fast, walk around the tables in a constant hurry and recite their script-like pleasantries with pinpoint precision.\n\nNot normally a fan of chains, Texas Roadhouse is a solid, middle-of-the-road steakhouse with good service, good steaks, and killer rolls. If you're part of the \"I Love This Bar\" crowd you'll feel like you just came home and if you're not you can grin and bear it for a well-cooked piece of meat and a damn good baked potato. You'll know you did it right when you can feel your already winter-pudged belly pressing against your belt and a slight sickening feeling washing over you. You've just been \"Roadhoused\".\n\nP.S.\nYou should check out the video on the Roadhouse website with founder Kent Taylor. He sort of reminds me of a combination of Dave Thomas and Ted Nugent.", "date": "2013-01-28 21:11:33"}

She said \"sorry the bartender kind of overflowed it, so just drink it fast.\" Which whatever, okay would have been fine I guess, but then I had to use my napkin that I planning to use when we got our meal. The waitress didn't give me any more napkins to wipe off the glass or give me a coaster. I work in customer service and presentation is everything and I would never have given a customer something like that and expected them to clean it up thereselves. The table and my hands were really sticky then from the shake and trying to clean it up. The waitress takes our order and and I had gotten a burger and asked for ranch for the fries. She said \"okay\" wrote it down and walked away. Some time went by and an other waitress brings us our food, literally drops it off to us and hurried up and left before we could ask for more napkins and I could ask for the ranch that was forgotten. Rachel and I went through almost our whole meal without The waitress checking on us, we never got our water refilled, and when she finally came and asked how everything was. I asked (because I saved my fries for last) for ranch. She says \"okay of course.\" She never came back! She gave us our checks, we paid and left.

Interesting question or a matter of simple math. Has this business been a victim of their own success? The viability of the Brooklyn, OH location certainly looks like a coin toss at this juncture. \n\nI hate to rip on one of my favorite sipping posts but I don't have kind words as of late. The only consistency with Hooley is change. Mostly, it's change for the worse!  \n\nI remember when they opened Brooklyn in 2014. I was a Hooley card member right away. They were open to 0230 every night and had great, friendly service and prices.  They tried different entertainment such as open mic Mondays. I heard some great saxophone play by one awesome employee and they earned originality points. Also, they had the best loyalty perks program around by far!!!\n\nSince then, the prices have gone up, the perks have gone down and the friendly faces have switched to their new locations in Westlake and Akron. \n\nWhile I haven't been to the original or newest Hooley, I can say Brooklyn appears to be forgotten. I get that the flats, W 25 St and Tremont exist. But, Hooley is not really competing against those venues. They are instead competing against themselves. \n\nOther then Wednesday's (Guinness), there are no real specials. They don't advertise much and there is no serious live entertainment. The perk points are 1/2 what they used to be. Food and beverage charges are up. So, what's the incentive for stopping by on a Friday at 10 pm? A quiet experience perhaps. That's right. I love that there's no crowds as of late, but how do you exist?\n\nIf they are banking on St. Paddys Day and football season to carry them through the year that is great. But, why not do more to draw people in all year long?\n\nHow about a live Irish music day, one day, every week? That will draw people.  It did for Stampers on Thursday's for years. It doesn't even seem like an Irish bar most days. Forget the dance, pop music first off!\n\nHow about Friday and Saturday bands in general? Even in the last fall/ winter season they didn't have many.

So they sent that piece back and I rescheduled again for a new couch. \nA day or so before my 3rd delivery, I was advised that they had to delay another week or two because they didn't have any deliveries scheduled. The original order was placed in March and the 3rd couch was coming in June. It was frustrating to say the least.\nAfter spending over  $1400, I was given a $50.00\nGift card to comp me for the inconvenience. Now, the couch that was replaced makes a strange noise when you put pressure on the arm. And I'm so afraid it will break like the other couches people have bought from Ashley (discovered after I read the reviews).  Money is tight for my family and this is was not an easy thing to just hand over $1400 + dollars. Not to mention time taken off for work and our busy schedules for delivery after delivery. And now we have a couch that makes a popping sound when you lean too hard? This is a mess and no one has ever made it right. This actually makes me sick to my stomach.  I hate to be that person but unfortunately I can never purchase anything from this company again, as customer service/satisfactory is not a priority.", "date": "2018-07-10 03:53:03"}

Gone are the Guinness  & Jameson specials. Surprise to all the long time regulars. Hooley has officially \"jumped the shark\". No wonder patronage is scare in the evenings. Might as well close at 8 pm since only the day time crowd seems to matter anymore. As for $6 Guinness drafts, those can be found anywhere and you actually get them in Guinness glassware at other establishments. No need to come to Hooley for that. Now, there are still some nice staff here but the price points really equate to a less desirable experience. \n\nThis used to be one of my favorite sipping posts but I don't so many kinds words as of late. It's hard to argue that it is a better place or experience from what it was in year one. The only constant is that is the head scratching changes. When the Brooklyn location opened in 2014 there was so much more to love about the place. They were open to 0230 every night and offered great, friendly service & prices.  They tried different entertainment such as open mic Mondays. They formerly had one of the best perk programs around. Now even that is half of what it used to be. Plus the prices have soared. The few specials they had are all but gone. They rarely offer new draft selections. And the live entertainment is all but extinct. There's not much incentive for stopping by at 10 pm on a Friday or after 7 pm most days.\n\nIt seems like they bank on St. Paddy's Day and football Sundays to carry them through the year. Why not do more to draw people in all year round? What happened to the regular Friday/Saturday bands? Overall, Hooley Brooklyn lacks an identity and direction. It doesn't even seem like an Irish bar most days. The last time they played Irish music was probably March 17. But, they sure like to play plenty of pop/dance music.  By the way, what kind of Irish bar doesn't offer Harp on draft? They can't even pour a true half and half draft! Brooklyn is the only Hooley, out of the 4 locations, that doesn't offer Harp on draft. And what's the allure of the roof top inflatables? That doesn't seem to draw more people in. Maybe the increased prices go to pay for the increased placement of inflatables!", "date": "2017-10-05 02:23:42"}

We always try the basic hot sauce when checking out wings or nuggets, just to get a good baseline. The light breading didn't hold a lot of the frying oil, and the chicken inside was moist and tasty. We opted for the sweet potato fries with the chicken and they were also perfectly done. My wife ordered a Reuben sandwich and tater tots, and raved about the sandwich. I ordered the turkey wrap with the house made chips, and it too, was tasty. The chips were crisp without being burned, and quite satisfying.

My review is primarily for the service. I met a friend here for lunch when they opened their doors at 11:00. So we were literally the first people here.  Our waitress was cheerful and thorough, allowing my friend and I time to catch up while I'm sure we were annoying as we kept asking for more time.  She was very accommodating and we placed our lunch order.  My friend had a simple cheeseburger which came out cooked to temp and he said it was just fine.  I ordered a philly wrap with French onion soup. The soup came out first, and though I was a bit weary of the red hue? It was quite good. The wrap however,  just slipped someone's attention in the kitchen.  Even though I have never been here before, I doubt this was their best work.  I don't need to go into details, it was just off. Let me also add that I am 9 months pregnant, so because of this I lost my appetite.  Now here is where I put the weight of my review...  I realize everything that comes out of a kitchen isn't going to be perfect.. And I know  I'm not ordering a 50 dollar porterhouse, but much too often I have seen ( or not seen) management show no concern about a single persons experience.  This was not the case. They could have easily said \" do you want a box? No? Ok\"  and give us a bill and call it a day. The actions of the staff is why I will be back.  Not only was the waitress genuinely concerned, she wanted to know exactly what I didn't like , and how they could fix the situation. I really was not looking for them to take it off the bill, I just didn't care for it. Soon after, a manager ( I am assuming) came to the table to apologize and try to rectify the situation. This was what sealed the deal for me.  The loyalty the staff had to their patrons, no matter how big their check is... Made my day.  They did take it off the bill, and even though I insisted I didn't want anything else, they made sure I had a new wrap to take home with me just in case.  And I will say, I just ate it for a late lunch,and it was like a different sandwich!  spot on.  Thank you Hooley House. For making me feel like I matter.", "date": "2016-02-02 19:49:20"}

My sales woman, Shelly, was aggressive, pushy, and overbearing. She was withholding about information about financing and told me the furniture protection plan was required if I was going to finance the couch. After purchasing the 200 dollar plan I did not want I found out that if I did the year financing plan I wouldn't have had to do that. I felt tricked. That is not sales with integrity.\n\nThe delivery was impossible to schedule, but they don't narrow the time down to a window, you just have to be home all day on the day you schedule. Because of conflicting work schedule (I don't work until 4 pm so have never had a problem with delivery times before- they made it very clear I would be charged a large fee if the truck came and I was not home) it took 2 weeks longer to get the couch than originally planned. I will say the drivers are who delivered and helped set everything up were absolutely fantastic. Professional and timely. \n\nI called the corporate office to voice my complaints and they did offer to refund half my delivery fee. They said it would take 10 business days. I called on Monday to check on it (it had been 12 business days) and the woman said it looked like it would be coming through the next day (Tuesday). Today (Thursday) I called because I still have not received it and he told me to expect it sometime next week. \n\nThis has been a completely horrible experience. I'm not even happy with my over priced furniture (but of course there is a 10% fee to return it).\n\nDon't give your money to this shady company. There are many better options out there for better quality furniture at the same if not better prices with sales associates who are knowledgeable and helpful.", "date": "2017-10-05 15:18:48"}

It's something we're known for, but isn't executed as well as it should be. The chili is what I like to call your \"base model\" chili. It's got hints of cinnamon and chili powder, but lacks salt, heat, the tang of a tomato base and dimension of flavors I think a chili should have. It's definitely geared to appease the masses of people with boring palates. It's definitely not appealing when paired with a bunch of overcooked, watery spaghetti that is piled high with shredded cheese that barely melts in entirety. The coney dogs are equally disappointing, as they are small, boiled hot dogs placed on bigger buns that they don't fill and piled with the ingredients of your choosing. \n\n...If you do make it to Skyline, do yourself a favor towards a decent, filling, and relatively tasty meal by ordering the five-way potato and top it with sour cream and hot sauce.

They said they think it is on the truck.  I called in the 9th week and asked where my chair was.  They said it would take 7-10 more days.  I was livid!!  I told them this is ridiculous and we should have had it by now.  Miraculously they called me back in an hour and said it is at the warehouse.  My husband and I went and picked it up on a Saturday because they were only open 9-2.  Got it home, unpacked it and set it in the living room.  IT IS THE WRONG CHAIR!  We paid for a power recliner and this was a standard.  I called the store and went off.  They told me they would have to wait until Monday to call the warehouse.  I said, they are open right now.  They said, that is just for pick ups.  I waited till Monday.  They called me at 11:30 and told me they gave me the wrong chair and mine is still at the warehouse.  They said they couldn't deliver it until Friday.  I said I want it tomorrow.  They said they would be there at 10 am Tuesday morning.  Didn't show until 10:45.  Set the new chair in my living room and something seemed off to me.  They left and I was looking over the chair and then laid it over and looked under it.  It is a USED chair!!  This is the chair out of their showroom!!  All 4 legs were scratched, marked up, dented and the bars underneath had all the paint coming off of them.  Not to mention, the manufacturer tag on the inside of the chair says Manufactured in October 2017 and shipped in October 2017.   I called the store right away and they still said it was the chair in their warehouse.  I said, you brought me the chair off your showroom floor.  She said, no that was in the warehouse.  I said, then this is a chair that was returned.  I even told her about the manufacturer label on the inside and she still lied to me.  I told them I want the chair picked back up and I want my money back.  She said she would refund half right now and the next morning she would pull our work order and refund us the other half.  Next day my husband got a voicemail saying they won't refund the other half until the chair is picked up.  So they lied again.

It's a large chain of low/mid-range furniture for all your home decor needs. It has a very typical home furnishing story layout, which is to say, kind of confusing. They try to set it up by making mini rooms throughout the store and you end up having to wander the entire massive complex in order to see everything of one type. For example, if you are looking for a bed, you'll have to traverse the entire cosmos in order to see the offerings. I'm sure the idea behind this is that they are trying to get you to buy more than one thing but it ends up translating to wasting a lot of time.\n\nAshley's furniture offerings aren't especially high quality but they do look nice. They are the type of pieces that will look good while they last but you should expect to replace them in a few short years. For most people this is fine. A lot of us can't afford to drop the cash required to get high end furniture. Their \"leather\" offerings are especially low quality (don't trust me on this, go touch and smell it and then do the same thing at Arhaus or Restoration Hardware).\n\nThe salesmen are a bit pushy so I'm assuming they work on commission. If you tell them that you aren't buying and are just looking then you'll probably never see them again. I find this type of salesmanship very obnoxious and shortsighted. \n\nI suppose Ashley is the right kind of store for a lot of people.

Someone went to a lot of trouble to make the place look extra Halloween-y (Halloweenie? Can I say that on Yelp?). It was really festive and fun and I very much enjoyed the little alcove we sat in. The seats were very comfortable and I felt like I was in someones house, just relaxing. \n\nGreat views of the TV from everywhere in the place and although it was crowded and loud, it wasn't deafening. \nOur service was excellent. Very attentive server who checked on us regularly but didn't hassle us when we wanted to sit too long and watch the end of the game. The kitchen kept up with the rapid pace and servers were busy running but also adding to the excitement of the Tribe win. Pounding on the wall, chanting with us... they made it a really fun atmosphere. I'm so glad we picked Hooley to watch the game.\n\nOur food was awesome. We started with the Irish Egg Rolls, which were about the best thing I've eaten all month. Corned beef, sauerkraut, and swiss cheese all rolled up and deep fried to perfect golden deliciousness. Served with a tangy 1000 Island sauce that was lip smacking. The pair was only $8.50 and was really quite enough for 4 people to share.\nThe boyfriend really loved the Hooley Club sandwich and my Fish and Chips were cooked perfectly.\n\nI can't wait to go back.

They also have mashed potatoes, which are really good.  Of course, they offer seasoned steak fries, but the seasoning is not awesome.

I had my account of four years with four lines in it, all smartphones with it comes a bill that's more than my car payment. I am currently in the military and am moving overseas so I needed to park two of my lines and the other two were looking to be renewed and buy two new smartphones. I was speaking with a gentleman named Zev or something like that, who is perhaps the rudest person I have ever met. I inquired if he could help me out with the two lines that I needed cancelled and also to price out the remaining two lines with new iPhones. He told me that he cannot help with the military issues as that is something that can only be handled by calling in. So turning to my other two lines he was unable to help us with any of the questions we had, we asked about pricing and he didn't know any of the costs of plans and said we would see the costs when our bill came in. We asked about the specials on the signs and again he had no idea about any of it. So finally we get frustrated with his rudeness and lack of competency and decide to head over to Verizon, he hears this and chuckles and says good luck. So we left and went to Verizon.

I would give them 0 stars if I could.\nI came into the store after talking with an online Sprint rep on their Chat service. The online rep assured me that, under the Total Equipment Protection (TEP) plan I had, they would be able to replace the cracked screen on my iPhone 4s. Lo and behold, after driving 30 minutes to this store (since they are a \"repair\" store according to Sprint's website), I am told by two different associates that they cannot fix a cracked screen, especially not on an iPhone. So I ask them, \"Why did the online rep tell me I could get this fix at a Sprint repair store?\" They have no clear-cut answer other than \"We can't work on iPhones, only Apple is allowed to do that\". At this point, I'm frustrated, but I ask them what, if anything, I can do to get my screen fixed under their TEP plan. They tell me I can send it in for a replacement, but I'll have to pay a $200 deductible. Why even have the insurance in the first place then?! They clearly won't fix a broken screen, and according to the associates I spoke with, they can't do anything to fix ANY physical problem with an iPhone. Either Sprint's TEP plan is absolute BS or this store is.\nSecondly, on the SAME trip into this store, I wanted to get an iPhone 6 (which had come in the mail after cashing in an upgrade on our Family Plan) activated. I had used my sister's upgrade to order the iPhone 6, but I requested that the associate activate the 6 for a different number than my sister's, which was the number that had been \"upgraded\". The associate tells me he can't do it. Something about not having both devices on hand/he couldn't do that because I had upgraded online and not in the store. He tells me if I had ordered my upgrade through their store, he would be able to switch the numbers no problem. Then, he goes on to tell me that the iPhone 6 is already activated with my sister's phone number, so any calls or texts she receives should be coming to the 6. I didn't believe him, so I took out my old phone (still activated/working) and texted my sister to ask if her current phone (iPhone 5) was acting up at all. She replied that no, everything was fine. I showed the texts to the associate who had JUST told me that her current phone shouldn't be receiving any texts. So he was wrong, but he still insisted that he couldn't do anything because in his computer it says the 6 is activated with my sister's number. He tells me I have to call Sprint and go through a 45 minute process with someone over the phone to switch the numbers. Do the stores and corporate offices not use the same computer systems? Is their software different? Is their clearance level different? I don't know, the associate offered nothing more than, \"I'm can't switch the numbers here, you have to call.\"\nNeedless to say, I was EXTREMELY frustrated walking out of that store having accomplished neither thing I went in there to do. I will not be going back to that store, and I will be spreading the word to all other Sprint customers that their TEP plan is a joke and a scam (at least for iPhones). Worthless.", "date": "2014-09-25 00:48:02"}

It's for these two reasons that I've been hesitant to make my way to the Hooley House. I simply don't suffer fools (or sports fans) well. On a recent Saturday evening, my wife and I decided to stray outside of our comfort zone. We were looking for some good pub grub and something close to home. We set out with low expectation and empty bellies. The result? Pleasant surprise, overly filled bellies and thoughts of another visit.\n\nHooley House is a sports bar painted with a brush dipped in a little Irish pub. The space is large, the menu even larger and they are comfortable in their skin. Located right in the middle of restaurant chain America, the Hooley House is the lone standout. The original location is in Mentor and this spot has only been open about a year (several restaurants have occupied this space, including a Don Pablo's). Hooley House added an open patio with a gas fireplace that looks really cozy, too.\n\nDid I mention that this place is big? As others have said, even when the parking lot looks full, inside there's probably still plenty of seating. The ceilings are tall, there are booths lining the perimeter, tables scattered about and a stage where they hold regular live entertainment shows. Like I said before, this is a sports bar and this is clearly evident with the dozens of flatscreens lining the walls. Not my thing, but if that gets you off you won't be disappointed. The space is separated into two distinct areas with the bar off to the right when you enter and the main dining/entertainment area in the back.\n\nOur server, Nyesha, was great. She was everything you could want in a server, friendly, attentive, an advocate of the establishment. She made sure we had everything we wanted and kept tabs on our progress without being intrusive.\n\nThere's also a clear bent toward the drinking crowd at the Hooley. They've got an extensive drink menu with traditional cocktails, beer cocktails, island drinks, fancy martinis, bombs of several varieties, wine and, of course, beer. Speaking of which, they've got 14 taps, mostly macros with a smattering of local and regional micros. During our visit they were featuring several holiday brews including locals Great Lakes Christmas Ale and Fat Head's Holly Jolly. Two of my personal favorites this time of year. If you're looking to imbibe you've got plenty of options here.\n\nThe menu here is pretty massive. It's filled with everything from wings and burgers to wraps and, as the name of the place implies, some Irish-inspired fare like shepherd's pie and boxty. They've also got several varieties of mac and cheese and grilled cheese. This is not a place to come if you're watching what you eat, but for the occasional cheat meal it's perfect. Tonight was one of those nights for us:\n\nLoaded tots - I love tater tots. Such a simple comfort food and these were perfect. Crunchy, hot, smothered in ooey-gooey cheese, chopped scallions and bacon. The side of sour cream a nice addition.\n\nWings - I opted for a half order of the hot garlic sauce variety. Crispy and smothered in an orange buttery hot sauce. Not terribly spicy but addicting. I recommend eating them quickly lest they get soggy. \n\nSlider sampler - I went this route so I could give all of their slider options a try. One each of cheeseburger, crispy chicken, corned beef, and turkey served on soft, white fluffbread buns. Not bad. I should have asked for some mayo as they were a bit on the dry side, but still tasty.\n\nTuna melt - Traditional. Tuna salad (mayo, relish, dill, tuna) topped with tomato and cheddar cheese on rye bread. A tad greasy but overall a solid offering. Crispy bread, melted cheese, nice seasoning.\n\nCole slaw - This is how slaw is done. Creamy, slightly sweet, crispy cabbage, onions some carrot. No funny business here.\n\nMac and cheese - Comfort food 101. A small crock of cheddar mac and cheese elbows the top slightly charred and crispy. Ridiculously good. This should be served on top of the loaded tots.\n\nHooley House was a good time for us. We got to sit at a comfy booth, had a fantastic server, and stuffed our guts with fat and carbs until we walked funny. We got exactly what we wanted and some of what we didn't expect.", "date": "2013-11-10 16:25:15"}

There's nothing better after a night of abusing your liver but it's also awesome at pretty much all other times as well.  \n\nSo sad that we don't have any restaurants like this in the great city of Chicago.  I have to store up on this chili-goodness when traveling to Indiana, Ohio, or Kentucky.  \n\nSo so actual location.  Cafeteria style.  You walk up and the food is slopped onto a plate and handed to you.", "date": "2011-06-21 16:17:58"}

After a few back and forth conversations, she told me everything was good, I wouldn't have to pay the $200 and she said to come back in. So again, I took time out of my day to come back into the store only to find out her boss did not fix it and did not wave the fees. She told me she'd have him fix it.

Typically, this isn't something that would upset me. The girl on the sales floor was amazing. However, what bothers me is that SPRINT REACHED OUT TO ME... and said they took care of something and then fell short on their word. I feel like this is completely awful customer service! And their store manager NEVER EVEN REACHED OUT TO APOLOGIZE OR EXPLAIN!! They just kept having a sales associate message me through Facebook. The whole thing made me mad, how are you about to approach me and tell me you took care of something and then just not do it??? What the hell is that?

Okay so another 10 min rolled on, and a few more couples getting seated that weren't there when we arrived, and tables and booths were looking pretty vacant!  Quick decision....should we leave or find out what was going on.  Took my buzzer up, and asked if perhaps my buzzer was malfunctioning.  Hostess that took my name looked at me like she had no idea who I was, looked at the buzzer, then to her screen, and without saying a word to me called over someone to seat us.\n\nGot to the seat....no bread.   Waited 10 min for the waiter...who took our drink orders only to come back after another 5min to tell me my beer wasn't available.  No beer.  \n\nOrdered Fried pickles for appetizer.   Pickles were good till the bottom, then got very soggy. Bread finally arrived, then another order of bread. \n\nFinally got to order our food....8:10pm.

And, yes, people on yelp are the first ones to know about this. I have a guilty pleasure, and it's going to eat at Skyline. I never take anyone with me - probably because I know how bad what I'm eating is for me, and I never tell anyone that I went after I've gone. The only people who know are me... and the employees... who - no matter how much time goes by between visits - are so friendly and talkative that they seem to remember me!! Now that I've gotten that off my chest.........\n\nFirst and foremost, I've never tried the actual Chili, but everyone I've gone to Cinci locations with has loved it - people who I've talked to who have said they don't like it is usually because they use chocolate / cinnamon in their chili and they don't care of that.\n\nBut, I've been frequenting skyline for years now. My best friend is from northern kentucky, so going to visit him years ago usually meant at least one trip to Skyline. I used to always get beans and rice with heaping amounts of cheese on top and cheese fries. That was until I moved to Cleveland 2 years ago and discovered that I had my very own Skyline on ridge road!! Every time I go, I get a chili cheese sandwich with beans and a three-way with beans (spaghetti, chili or beans, and cheese). Their oyster crackers and hot sauce are AWESOME. \n\nLike I mentioned earlier, the employees are freakin awesome! Legit. Hilarious, friendly, and fun to talk to.\n\nI love me some skyline.", "date": "2014-08-10 00:36:08"}

I am older and wiser now and I was looking forward to Skyline during our trip to Ohio.  I did have a can of Skyline chili a couple of months ago (thank you, Walmart) but I was waiting to go to an actual Skyline.\n\nWe finally went a couple of days ago.  I decided to get a loaded chili bowl that included beans, onions, sour cream and of course the chili and beautiful mound of cheddar cheese.  Of course the bowl was delicious.  I definitely ate it all and was sad when I ran out.  But at least I saved room for frozen yogurt.  \n\nThe only thing I can really say is that my boyfriend and I were both wearing Kylo Ren shirts (we totally did this by accident, I swear).  One of the guys behind the counter said to me, \"I gotta tell you, I did not like Kylo Ren\".  Okay.  I don't go to people telling them I don't like whatever is on their shirt, but I do enjoy a good nerd conversation sometimes.  As long as the other person agrees with me or I get to tell them their opinions are wrong and they are stupid (kinda kidding).\n\n\"Well, that's your problem,\" I say, half-jokingly.\n\nSpoiler alerts to follow if you haven't seen The Force Awakens for some reason but still plan to...\n\n\"He almost got defeated by a girl that had no Jedi training,\" he says.\n\n\"Well, he's still an apprentice himself,\" I say.

And I LIKED Rey.\n\n\"He killed his father,\" he counters.\n\n\"Do you not know how Star Wars villains work?\" I ask.\n\nThis somehow was the end of the conversation, but at this point I was mildly annoyed with the guy as was the boyfriend.  He's lucky I don't take a star off.  Buddy, don't talk shit about characters your customers like.  If we were at a party I probably would've schooled the shit out of this guy but ultimately made him my best friend because man do I like to argue, but I was just trying to enjoy some post-Cleveland Zoo chili with my boyfriend, his dad and his stepmother.\n\nAnyway, I'm back in Tennessee and Tennessee doesn't have any Skylines.

I estimate that we've eaten at this location about a dozen times over the years but our last two visits were not great.  Last week, my husband called ahead on a Sunday afternoon to secure a table when we arrived in 30 minutes.  Our frustration began in the parking lot because there was no parking so we had to park way in the back.  As soon as we walked in, we knew we were in trouble.  The front entrance was chaotic with no type of organization.  At the hostess desk, they looked in vain for our call-ahead seating reservation code and they couldn't find it. When they realized it was not there, they seated us anyway.  I swear, the 2-seat booth they gave us is meant for pre-schoolers.  It was so uncomfortable, we asked to move to another table.  Of course, they had nothing else so we left, hungry and upset.\n\nYesterday, we decided to give it another shot.  Since my husband took the day off, we were able to arrive at 3:30 on a Friday afternoon for an early dinner.  This time, it was not so busy that you couldn't hear yourself think.  Normally, the noise level in this restaurant when full is cacophonous and not at all pleasant for those sensitive to a loud atmosphere.  Anyhow, this time we were seated at a four-top for the two but it was wobbly which is PET PEEVE NUMBER 1.  The hard chairs were really low so I felt like I was at the kid's table on Thanksgiving.  Why are they so low?  By the way, their two-top tables are very small with not a lot of room for plates, drinks and silverware.\n\nWe were greeted by our server Ashley and ordered our food right away.  I'm a fan of chopped steak so I had the Road Kill with no cheese, baked sweet potato and salad.  Hubby ordered the Smothered Chicken with fries and salad.  The salads took a while but we kept busy with the delicious rolls and butter.  The tasty salads were fresh and crisp which is something I critique in restaurants.  PET PEEVE NUMBER 2 - I despise salads that are limp with old greens and big pieces of romaine stalks.  My well-seasoned chopped steak was cooked a perfect medium and the mushroom/onion topping was wonderful.  Hubby loved his smothered chicken and ate it with gusto.  My baked sweet potato was good but there wasn't enough butter for the size of it and there was no brown sugar like I had on our last successful visit.  I would have asked Ashley to remedy this but she had LEFT US FOR DEAD.  She didn't come back to ask how our food was or how we were doing which is PET PEEVE NUMBER 3.  The server should always check back with the customer a few minutes into their meal.  She returned after we were all done to give us the check which we paid and left her a 10% tip.  We normally give 20-25% for good service.\n\nOne note about this restaurant:  The layout of it is insane.  The problem begins at the entrance where there is only room for customers either going in OR coming out.  You have to wait for people to move away from the hostess desk in order to leave the restaurant.  It's very frustrating and I think it's a fire hazard.  The layout of the entire place is poorly configured, crowded and very uncomfortable.  Chip Gaines from Fixer Upper would call this the \"Crazy Maze Restaurant\".  It doesn't flow at all and the people who designed the floor plan and should be taken to task for lack of vision.\n\nWill we go back?  Perhaps because the food is really good and usually consistent.  However, there are many other factors that prevent us from making this spot a regular choice for a pleasant meal.", "date": "2018-08-04 17:37:14"}

We were greeted by the waitress and seated promptly.  The menu is pretty plain as far as layout goes, nothing really seems to stand out.  I ordered chicken fettuccine alfredo, my daughter ordered fettuccine alfredo, and my husband ordered the barbecue chicken pizza.  We also ordered cheese curds for an appetizer.\n\nThere was only one waitress working and even though it was just us and one other table, she seemed to be a little overwhelmed.  Our cheese curds came out in decent time and were very good and squeaky!  Our entrees took a little longer than I would have liked but still in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nMy husband said that while his pizza was flavorful, the crust seemed to be a little flimsier than he would prefer.  My chicken fettuccine alfredo was pretty blah.  I've had more flavorful alfredo sauce at Olive Garden.  I also found a small piece of chocolate chip pancake in my meal, which is pretty odd and really threw me off.  The table next to us had some kids that were having chocolate chip pancakes so I assume that's where it came from but I still can't figure out logistically how it could have happened as their pancakes came out way before my meal did.  \n\nI was a little irritated that while my daughter is only 5, that she didn't get a full serving of fettuccine alfredo.  It wasn't on the kids menu so I figured we would just get an adult sized portion and have leftovers.  Her portion was much smaller than mine but only $3.50 cheaper.  I would have much rather paid for an adult meal at that price.  Her meal alone was $7 and that was just for fettuccine alfredo; no drinks or sides.  \n\nOverall it was an okay experience.  Our total came to $42 for 2 adult meals, a kids meal, and an appetizer.  We all had water to drink.  I can't say we will be back to the actual restaurant but we may order pizza for delivery sometime.

While I will use this review to cover Skyline Chili independent of other places, I want to point out that this style of chili is what this area of the country is known for and quite frankly I think it's terrible. It doesn't mesh well with my palate. I realize that by saying this, I am trampling on a long cherished tradition in this area. And frankly, I'm sticking to it. I realize that your mothers and grandmothers fed this to you as a child... and on their behalf I apologize for years of abuse. \n\nChili should be hearty and robust and spicy. Heck if you want a decent chili, go try the one at Zoup. It at least resembles a real chili. Skyline chili has a texture that reminds me of cream of wheat (and not in a good way). But beyond that it is relatively flavorless with the exception of some odd taste that is somewhat reminiscent of cinnamon. It's also served in a really weird way - on noodles. I am fairly adventurous but these textures and flavors just didn't mesh well for me.\n\nI think another thing that bothered me is that, being unfamiliar with this style of chili, I felt confused by the menu. The staff weren't very helpful when I expressed my confusion either. \n\nI'm glad you all love this chili but I'll pass on it and find some real chili!", "date": "2014-03-29 23:59:35"}

When the doctor finally walked in, rather than shake my hand or greet me nicely, he handed me his business card and then took a seat about ten feet away on the other side of the room with a counter and exam table between us when there were two chairs right in front of me or to the side. He reviewed my referral sheet, I answered some questions and then he proceeded to discount everything I'd experienced at PP. When I asked him why he didn't think their assessments and recommendations were legit, he responded by saying \"Well, they aren't specialists\". He recommended I come back in three months, as if I'd bothered him with a hangnail.\n\nI went home, promptly made an appointment with a different doctor for a second opinion and will not be returning to Dr Bashour.

He not only took us to our seats but waited on us as well.  Just for the record that is not Aldo, but I wonder if it's not his father, brother or uncle. Regardless, he does his job very well. \n\nMy wife had that iconic dish, spaghetti and meatballs and said it was great. I opted for the Frittura Pesce which is sauteed calamari, scallops and shrimp served with a side of marinara sauce. It was perfect. I will likely order it again the next time we go. \n\nSo, Aldo, if you read these reviews apologies for not visiting more often. We promise to rectify that. And a h/t to Bob for motivating us to get back there.", "date": "2013-09-04 16:07:57"}

She'd traveled America and Europe and had dined in many an upscale establishment. When she raved about this tiny trattoria in Brooklyn, I knew we just had to give it a try.\n\nAldo's sits at the corner of a small strip plaza on Memphis Avenue, and you'd be forgiven for mistaking it for a take-out pizza joint.  This place is remarkably small, yet absolutely adorable. It seats approximately twenty or so patrons, with an innovative bar/server station tucked into a nook adjacent to the kitchen entrance. Seating can be tight, especially along one of the banquettes that run along the periphery of the room.  Several small two-top tables are also available, but were all occupied during our visit.  The close quarters could be disconcerting to some diners, and is something to consider if you decide to visit.\n\nFortunately, the food at Aldo's was everything my boss had gushed about, and then some.  We're talking antipasto, pizzas, lasagna, piccatas, marsalas, fettuccine, ravioli, gnocchi, tiramasu, zabaione and everything in between, finished off with coffee and sambuca.  We both chose one of the evening's specials, a mixed seafood scampi served with lightly seasoned white rice and mixed vegetables.  Tender shrimp and scallops, cooked perfectly.  \n\nWe struck up a brief conversation with another couple-regulars enjoying a Saturday night out-who beamed when they bragged about how the kitchen makes a special wedge salad for them with Bleu cheese and house dressing \"on the side.\"\n\nAldo himself was ever-present during our visit, mingling amongst the tables; making sure his guests were enjoying their meals. His face lit up when we told him it was our first visit, seemingly flattered that we chose his restaurant based on a glowing  recommendation. \n\nFor authentic Italian cuisine, Aldo's delivers...although we will probably return on a weeknight for a more subdued dining experience.", "date": "2017-07-19 03:59:43"}

Very nice dinner lighting, and handsome decorations line the interior space. \n\nI soon noticed how comfortable, relaxed and talkative the other guests were in the dining room; you could tell everyone was having a very nice time. Management and staff are very nice and family-oriented, and it felt comfortable and like being at home interacting with them. My server and another nice lady took the time to be very personable, striking up friendly conversation with me.\n\nThe food was wonderful, a lot more fine-dining and higher-presentation than I normally am accustomed to. I had the Eggplant Parmesan for appetizer, the Veal Scaloppine for entree and the chocolate mousse for dessert. Every recipe seemed appropriately portioned, and was very flavorful and satisfying. \n\nThough I was there close to closing time and by the time dessert came around, was the only person left in the dining room, my server encouraged me to try dessert and coffee, and even brought out the full dessert tray, complete with recomendations and opinions of each. The mousse was chocolatey and just terrific.\n\nThough the prices are slightly higher here, I feel they are appropriate for the higher-quality food and finer-dining experience. Combine that with the friendly family atmosphere, the beautiful ambience, along with the helpful, efficient service, I came away feeling very happy with the visit. I highly recommend this fine Italian restaurant.", "date": "2011-12-03 01:58:23"}

I had low expectations given the location, but we were pleasantly surprised.  Tiny TINY place, with no place to wait if they're busy, so be prepared for that.  Maybe 10 tables.  Our waitress was excellent, one of those career waitresses that knows everything there is to know about the menu.  Super efficient, our water never went dry and everything arrived in a timely manner.\n\nI ordered an angel hair seafood scampi-style dish, based on her recommendation.  The seafood was done just about perfectly (although they don't tail their shrimp, which drives me a little nuts).  Everything was seasoned well.  My wife got the eggplant parm and was impressed.  Entrees come with rather large side salads and excellent bread.  The house salad dressing wasn't great...tasted like oil & vinegar with not enough vinegar.\n\nIt's not all wine and roses at Aldo's, however.  The dining area is very tiny and extremely loud, more like a busy corner bar on a Friday night.  Don't plan on any intimate conversations there.  The prices were a bit on the high side, with entrees averaging around $22.  That seems like a lot, given the location and atmosphere, plus the portions were smaller as well.  For that kind of dosh at an Italian restaurant, I generally expect to have leftovers.  For comparison, my wife and I like Stella Mia Ristorante in Westlake.  It's also in a strip mall, but the ambiance is MUCH nicer and the food's of a similar quality.  And you get quite a bit more of it, for similar pricing.\n\nTo sum up, they do a lot with what they have at Aldo's, and if you're in that area and want to stay local, it's a solid experience.  But if you don't mind driving, there are better overall choices.", "date": "2018-01-22 14:24:51"}

The meal started with hot fresh bread and butter, followed by a tasty mixed green salad with homemade dressing, yummy. Entree with delish al dente mixed veggies and side of angel hair with marinara. Frankly I enjoyed everything. I didn't find desserts listed on the menu so I asked for the dessert menu.  Was told there was no dessert menu but...there was a dessert tray...enticing. My waitress brought a tray with several offerings, I had difficulty choosing but my selection was wonderful. I enjoyed the coffee with dessert, which I noticed when I looked at the bill was a reasonable $2 for an endless cup. And if that wasn't enough, I noticed that the little girl at the table across from me eating with her parents had gone into the back room and returned with another of the desserts that looked so yummy. Apparently Aldo let her choose a dessert which she was obviously enjoying. With such a friendly warm family atmosphere, there's no doubt in my mind that he just let her have the desert gratis. I wanted to let him know how much I appreciated him, the meal and the experience. I gave him a hug and talked for a minute before leaving. What a special man and what a wonderful restaurant.

We were welcomed at the back door (they are redoing their parking lot in front) by Aldo himself and led through the kitchen to a great table.  It felt like being welcomed into the family home. The place was packed!  (Regular restaurant closed this night only for the special clam bake event).  A lot of the crowd seemed like family or regulars so I felt privileged to be included in the event. (Our friends know the owner). \n\nThe wait staff was so friendly and helpful. They worked as a team as it was a busy night with all the courses of the bake. Broth to start, savory, salty and very hot. Chowder next, hearty and tasty as all get out. Seafood crepe as appetizer in a Pomodoro type sauce. Fresh and tasty. Bring on the clams!  We knocked out 10 dozen at our table alone. Delicious middle neck. Tender, slightly sweet and delicious in the drawn butter provided. Now, the entree...lobster tails and filet accompanied by candied, spiced sweet potatoes and corn served up family style.  Thank goodness I had a light lunch!   We finished it all off with Spumoni wrapped in pound cake, cannoli and fresh fruit. \n\nI have heard great things about this place for some time but have never managed to get there. So glad we went!  We will definitely be back for more. Make a reservation. It's a small place.", "date": "2017-10-04 20:17:10"}

It's in a lackluster plaza, with a narrow entry way leading into a tiny dining room. Maybe 12 tables? Very crowded. \n\nThe menu wasn't huge, but when you offer authentic, delicious food, you don't need a lot of options. There was a LOT on the specials board. It's clear that Aldo's specialty is seafood, which I will have to come back and try.\n\nOur server was a doll. The staff was very attentive to our table and pleasant. A local, family owned place like this cant survive without top notch service and they obviously get that!\n\nI ordered the house salad, which, the server made sound plain. \"It's just lettuce, cabbage and carrot\". I added the cheese and went with the house dressing. This was a lovely salad. Crisp mixed greens with all the fixings and an amazing dressing. It was like a shallot balsamic vinaigrette maybe? With the fresh baked bread, I could have made a meal of that.\n\nI had a taste for chicken parmesan, which wasn't on the menu. Wait, what?\nI told my waitress and she explained they can make one- it's not breaded and it comes in a casserole dish. (I think that's what's pictured in the Aldo's profile). This chicken parmesan was so good. Cheesy, saucy and hugely flavorful. I loved the baked chicken and of course the side of pasta.  \n\nThis was not a cheap meal, but I felt it was worth the price.

The wait staff is outstanding.  But, I think we are done with our Aldo's experience.  The problem isn't the food or the staff.  It is the size of the place.  We have been to Aldo's probably eight times over the last two years.  Every single time, there are one or two \"celebration dinners\" there at the same time.  Now, this isn't Aldo's fault, except that maybe they should consider when they take reservations to limit how many celebrations they will allow at one time.  We were there yesterday.  The first birthday celebration (party of nine) arrived at the same time we did (4:30).  And because they were also expecting an even bigger group (a party of 13) at 5:30, we were jammed into a very uncomfortable booth/corner.  And, lucky us, we got stuck with the second group sitting very up close and personal to our table.  Truly people, if you are bringing such a large group to a restaurant, why do you pick the smallest restaurant on the west side of Cleveland?  And, by the way, this isn't your dining room, so don't hold conversations (or arguments) the length of the table.\n\nAgain, none of this is Aldo's fault and maybe we should try lunch on a Tuesday.", "date": "2017-03-20 18:57:17"}

She was curt and unapologetic. 10:00pm I phoned back because the food did not arrive yet. JoAnn was downright rude this time, mocking my question as to where my food was by telling me she has no way of knowing where the delivery man is at any given time. She seemed pissed at ME for not being more understanding to HER plight. I demanded a call from the district manager and a refund. She informed me it would take weeks for the refund. She told me the food was not sitting around getting cold and would arrive hot. 10:20pm the food arrived. It was cold, the chicken wings were bloody. No call from the district manager. Called the store back on Sunday. JoAnn told me the bad food, 2 1/2 hour delivery and all was out of her control. I again demanded a call from the district manager. He finally called back and informed me never to order from his store again, that Pizza Hut corporate office would not care if I complained, and basically tough crap that the food was awful and the delivery ridiculously slow. He said his company owns all of the Cleveland stores so, basically, piss off. NO PROBLEM. All of this is going to corporate, not that I expect a corporation to actually give a crap if they do business with franchises like this. Bottom line: Don't go here unless you like spending lots of money for very slow delivery, cold, half-cooked food and a rotten attitude if you try and complain.

The waiting area consists of a hallway but the gentleman was nice enough to bring wine when we asked if there was a bar ( we are first timers) \n\nI kept accidentally knocking down someone's walker on the floor which was quite annoying and noticed someone was leaning on a wine rack and it kept swaying, (SCARY) the waiting area has halogen lights above so it's very hot and no sitting.\n\nThe bread was a bit burnt and it seemed to be the waitress's first night, she didn't introduce herself, she walked up and said \"Do you want an appetizer?\" My husbandsaid Hello, How are you... When I said it was our first time here and inquired more she just explained that it's too bad we were here on such a busy night and u can tell her immediate goal was to get us in and out asap, not how we wanted to enjoy our wedding anniversary but I understand busy. The waitress had a  \"tat\" peeking out of her chest which is fine when I go to a bar or casual place but seemed odd in this setting... Our total was near 100 bucks so I expect a little better service. When I asked her how long she's been at the establishment she said a year and a half... She read us no specials and took no additional time then needed to make our dinner special so her tip reflected that. I liked the calamari but my husband did not, he said it was burnt tasting. He got Veal parm and I got the Aldo's seafood special which (I was referred to this restaurant by a special lady in Solon she said to ask for spicy red sauce ) I requested with \"spicy\" red sauce and the waitress told me to throw some red pepper flakes on it which she pointed to on the table... OK she said that's all the kitchen would do anyways. It was good, liked it all but my husband just wasn't feeling any of it. He said the veal was too buttery tasting and he asked for a side of rigatoni which she told us as she set the meal down that \"they ran out of it\" UMMM OK it was 6:00. We opted to not get dessert and get the heck out since we were feeling rushed and pushed anyway. We were some of the youngest clients in there and my husband is a huge fan of Nido Italia so it will be hard to get him to come back even though I enjoyed the food. \n\nI think if they would have taken reservations and staffed accordingly the service would have made a more enjoyable experience overall. The service killed our experience here and would probably prevent us from coming back. We don't get out often having a 1 year old so we were really looking forward to this, the place is very small.", "date": "2015-01-01 00:37:59"}

There was no host stand and we walked right into the dining room. We were greeted immediately with servers apologizing that there were no both seats available to put our sleeping child. I said it was ok, I could hold him and they gave us a table in the middle of the small dining room. \n\nOur server was so kind and knowledgeable. She was helpful with the menu and asked us questions based on our dietary restrictions and hunger levels. Warm crusty bread was on our table and we had no idea when that happened. We ordered the appetizer eggplant parmesan.  It was so rich and delicious. Perfectly seasoned and the marinara was so good. \n\nWhen a booth opened up they encouraged us to lay our son down and continue to enjoy our dinner. We did and the owner put a couple of chairs next to the both seat so our so wouldn't roll into the floor. He turned down the lights and jokingly said he would tell new patrons that \"I paid the bill! I don't know what happened!\" We had pizza and sauteed calamari. The server brought us more marinara for dipping because I had said how good it was. Both dishes were very good! The calamari was great with the right amount of chew, saltiness and a slight crispy outside. Our son woke of course in time for dessert! Everyone was so sweet to him and told him how happy they were he was finally awake. \n\nI'm so sorry this is so long but our experience was so unlike any other and it really made our day.

They are trying to accommodate a move. \n   Other than that no real complaints. Bed seems decent. Place is pretty clean. But the smoke just negates any positive accolades I can leave here.  Just don't get a third floor room. I always forget that.\n\nUpdate 7.31.15\n  Well the air conditioner sucks. A week ad a half ago they had the maintenance guy look at it. A note was left in my room saying something about waiting for a part or a new unit altogether. That was the 19th it's now the 31st and nothing has been sai or done. I've asked a few times about getting a new room and each time they poo poo the idea saying they don't have any vacancies. Bullshit. There's no way there at capacity.

That's why I was pretty hesitant to even try Aldo's. Seems like everyone loves this place. Add to that the fact that I never go out for Italian food and you could see why it wasn't that high on my list. So what overcame the activation energy? Bada Bing...\n\nI've been bingeing on episodes of Sopranos for the last few weeks so my head's been swimming in manicotti and cannoli. Aside from a primer on the RICO Act that show's a treatise on Italian cuisine - they're always eating. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it was only a matter of time before I had to seek out some food from the boot. This place is a stone's throw from my front door, some Yelpers I respect gave it high marks and it's not an Olive Garden, Brio or Bravo. \n\nLet's set the scene. Late afternoon, a small, out-of-the-way strip mall populated by a smokeshop, dentist, massage parlour and salon in the blue collar city of Brooklyn. Aldo's is the lone culinary standout. The signage overhead a script \"Aldo's\" and the Italian flag, frozen mid-wave. \n\nWe entered the front door into a short, narrow hall, two-top tables lining the wall, specials board on the wall straight ahead. We were immediately greeted by a smiling, silver-haired gentleman we could only assume was Aldo himself. He gestured to the handwritten specials list and asked with words drenched in the sing-songy accent of his home country if it was our first time. I nodded and he proceeded to lead us to our table toward the back. He took our drink orders and brought waters and fresh-baked bread.\n\nDimly lit, textured walls painted warm gold and decorated with the unsmiling, old-timey faces of family, the space is definitely tight though not uncomfortably so. I wonder if there's a secret back room for sit-downs? I've been watching too much tv. Our server, Katie, was genuinely pleasant with a love for the restaurant that was evident in her delivery. She was patient, knew the menu intimately and really made our experience. We had studied the menu before our visit so we already had a plan. Lascia mangiare.\n\nThe bread - Who doesn't love warm, crusty bread smeared with butter? It's almost genetically programmed in us, right? This bread is perfect.\n\nThe calamari - Lightly breaded, sauteed a crispy golden brown and served with warm marinara sauce. A wonderful way to start the meal.\n\nThe pizza - Sausage and pepperoni on an 8\" pie. The sauce was fresh and full of roasted tomato flavor and the crust had a slight sweetness I found pleasant. Fresh basil was a nice touch. A solid offering.\n\nThe chicken marsala - We went classic with this one. The chicken, pounded thin, was fork-tender and the mushroom wine sauce, while rich, wasn't heavy. I've had this dish a lot and this rendition was spot on. The accompanying vegetables, a mixture of zucchini, broccoli, carrots and peppers was underwhelming and just barely cooked. I prefer my carrots and broccoli on the softer side. The side of angel hair pasta with red sauce wasn't noteworthy, tasty, but not memorable.\n\nThe side salad - It came with the entree. A fresh mix of greens, red cabbage, julienned carrots and a vinaigrette loaded with a field of garlic. We opted for a topping of shredded mozz. The dressing was delicious and this made for a nice intermezzo before the entree.\n\nThe spumoni roll - We'd never had spumoni before and it looked great on the dessert tray. The ice cream was smooth, balanced by the textural elements from the dried fruit and nuts and the liquor-soaked cake was potent. A unique dish, for sure, but not one I'd order again.\n\nAldo's is everything everyone else says it is - intimate, unpretentious, charming, a hidden gem. We dine early so there were no crowds. We felt welcomed by everyone and the service was brilliant. Sure, the food is good and, since I've never been to Italy, I couldn't tell you how \"authentic\" it is, but I didn't have anything during our visit that had me dreaming of another helping. What I did have were thoughts of a repeat visit to try something else and experience more of the hospitality that this place has oozing out of every red, white and green pore.", "date": "2013-08-29 12:19:32"}

The sauce was like thin milk--no thickness. The baby loved it because she likes plain noodles. The lasagna seemed fine but over-priced $12.95 for lunch. Yelp menu prices for this place are all wrong. My angel hair w seafood was only o.k. For $21.95 was a ripoff. The wedding soup was really good but still $4.50 for mostly          spinach flavored water. Still, it was the best thing I ate. Would like to say pistachio gelato was good but they were out of that too. We waited so long that good thing portions were small--I had eaten lots of bread while waiting. You know, maybe i'm wrong about some things. But I am certainly not wrong that $100.00 is too much for a mediocre lunch for three people (no wine). Never again. And yelp needs to fix menu prices.

I was shown to a table and offered bread, wine and personal recommendations for appetizers.  I had an eggplant and spinach app that was excellent.  For dinner, I went with \"old faithful\", spaghetti and meatballs.  Mama mia, it was delicious!  My wife (and my mother-in-law) make incredible meatballs from scratch and I dare say, Aldo's were on par.  I was told he comes in every morning to make them himself.

He insisted on removing them all. ALL OF THEM.  I was newly married, young and naive. I should have had a second opinion but I had never had a bad dentist before him so I just trusted his word. How I regret that. So, no, they were not silver filings - kind of kills his whole point. Oh and forgot to mention he wanted to clip where my daughters lip meets her gum (can't remember what it's called). Claimed it would make her teeth crooked as she got older.

By far the absolute worst Golden Corral I've ever been to!

The selection of food that was offered at the buffet was 20% full at best...and the 20% that was offered was dried out.  Several customers asked the manager (who was also grilling) if he would be filling up the buffet soon and he made some wise-ass remark about taking a while to complete the task.  He spoke to us as he was flipping 8 sliders on the grill for the 40+ customers in the building at the time.  When the sliders were done, two customers barged in and snagged them up!  That was it for the food for the day!  The manager provided us with one bucket of mashed potatoes to go along with our dried out chicken and okra!  Oh, I did see corn, dinner rolls and some pizza available.  We waited over an hour there and no new food provided! I had my greasy spoon and dirty fork ready, but the food never came out! What I did eat, exited my body very quickly after I left the building!  Don't even get me started about the men's bathroom!  Stall #1 was a biohazard!  FEMA should have been called in ASAP!  No toilet paper and water all over the floor (thus having to leave the building).  Behind the salad bar, one employee was pumping yellowish sludge out of what looked like a backed up washer.

Not when you have your hands in my mouth and it just sounds like you're being a mean girl. Furthermore, she was incredibly rough and then had the gaul to tell me my gums were bleeding a lot. Yes, Freddy Kruger, they are bleeding a lot. I think it has to do with you haphazardly hacking away at them.

She kept trying to point out things on the x-rays that clearly weren't there.. she would say \"can you see that tiny little fleck of shadow?

Sometimes the best food isn't where you would expect to find it...and I've proven this on multiple occasions.  For example, see my reviews of La Casita Blanca and Hounddog's Three Degree Pizza.\n\nWhen it comes to my taste buds, I will not discriminate.\n\nhttp://www.goldencorral.com/", "date": "2009-10-24 11:10:13"}

Then other ppl in line are telling me that it's common at this location, seriously!? \nI am completely appalled at the behavior of the staff, not only the girl who verbally attacked me, but the staff who thought it was funny while standing there laughing, talking amoungst themselves and talking  about an upset customer and then a manager who could care less.

I was expecting a wickedly painful cleaning - and a lot of sighing and head-shaking from a dentist who would be irritated about how much remedial work my neglected teeth needed.

The office is sleek and pleasant, with white couches and tasteful mod decor.  The receptionist and hygienist were genuinely friendly and upbeat, so I had a pretty fine relaxing morning despite the click-scrape-whirrrr-whirrrr of metal tools and water and teeny suction hoses in my mouth.  The hygienist was very knowledgeable (totally unlike the usual going-through-the-motions grump), and readily discussed some options for post-ortho work I can have done to make my teeth brushing routine less of a hassle.  The Doc himself was what ya call a swell guy. I do need to have a few minor issues addressed at a later appointment, and he let me know about it without any condescension.  \n\nI'll be returning to Smile Design next month, and I'm almost ... looking forward to a dental appointment?

You will regret it. Do not be fooled with the modern waiting area and friendly receptionists. The dentists do not know what they're doing. \n\nI went to Smile Design during the spring of 2015 for a check up and cleaning. My last dentist appointment was a year prior to this and decided to change because of proximity to home. The initial dentist at Smile Design recommended a crown replacement (which wasn't bothering me at all by the way) but she suggested it was corroding and a small cavity filling on another lower tooth.\n\nI decided to go ahead with both recommendations. Big mistake. The crown fitting took 5 times (a different dentist saw me) and then once it was placed, I had to return three times within 6 months because it kept falling off. One dentist even recommended that I don't chew on the side of the crown which was ridiculous. I chewed on the previous crown for ten years with no issues. AND...where they drilled my cavity (which was done by another different dentist) I have continued sensitivity issues to this day. \n\nI went back to my old dentist who is a well respected dentist in New York and a teacher at NYU Dentistry and on the Board of the American Dental Society and he said that first of all, there was no reason to replace my crown. It was perfectly fine. And the drilling was done too close to the nerve. He has to replace my crown and he already re-drilled my cavity to place a sealant. \n\nI filed for a peer review with the American Dental Society and Dr. Mapes' office never returned the signed papers. I lost the case because too much time lapsed. Now I have to pay for another $2,000 crown procedure and I already paid another $600 for the cavity re-filling. \n\nClearly, this was a money making scheme and the lack of professionalism and experience was very very clear from this experience.", "date": "2017-02-12 14:07:01"}

I did a root canal/crown there, a couple of years ago and at the onset of the procedures I explicitly asked for \"costs and predetermination\", the billing manager assures me of costs, tells me that i will be charged in-network rates. Particularly noteworthy because if she hadn't i would have walked away. She even spelled out the costs - by email, then proceeded to collect my portion of the payment on the day of procedure and settle at that point. After they had collected thousands of dollars from my insurance company for root canal/post/crown using duplicated procedure codes for the exact same treatment they then sent me a bill - 1.5 years later with erroneous payment info that doesn't match the Claim Receipt Payment from the insurance company. By that time, the original manager who dealt with insurance/received payment and got the business -  had left the company. Their predetermination vs what they actually bill vs insurance claim receipts don't match. This is fraud.", "date": "2018-07-09 03:36:02"}

I had my x-rays sent over from my previous dentist because they were done only 2 months prior, the hygienist reviewed them but never checked for oral cancer and never examined my neck and jaw for abnormalities- just continued to tell me how much work I needed while she performed the VERY basic cleaning. \n\nI did not have x-rays done AND I didn't have a complete \"comprehensive oral evaluation\"-- but was billed $225?? \n\nAlso- exams AND cleanings are the same price, ehh??

Emphasize the word \"Supervise\". I've seen big family parties where the adults are so busy laughing and gorging themselves that the kids are running wild. That said, the employees and managers have a duty to say something to the parents. But........ in the way the world is today, that might be construed as racist or prejudice in some manner. \n\nIt's just a point to remember next time you go to GC for some food and people watching.", "date": "2015-01-09 22:41:08"}

The manager (if you want to call him that), didn't bother to ask why was your experience just ok, was there an issue with the food, service...anything!

Knowledgeable doctor, nice staff, very clean and up-to date equipment. However, this place has recently hired a new manager, my old doctor has left, and things are not how they used to be. \nFirst of all, last time I went in for a cleaning a couple months ago they tried to charge me for my cleaning, and this is WITH my insurance. My reaction was, wait, what?! I spoke with the manager who explained that they accept ALL insurances, but that basically if your insurance doesn't cover their minimum they will charge you extra $$$, which they decide based on their own calculations. (The point is, these people want MONEY, and they are in an expensive neighborhood, and need to cover their expensive equipment.) The manager told me that she would waive the charge this time, and that they would accept my insurance for the fillings I needed to get done on my next visit.\n\nSo I came in yesterday for a 6 pm appointment for the fillings, and the receptionist informed me she's been trying to reach me, (she called me 40 minutes prior to my appointment). She told me I needed to pay $400!!!! For fillings covered by my insurance. Hell no lady. I asked her that if this was the case, why did she tell me on my last visit that it would be covered, and why did she wait 2 WEEKS to get in touch with me? These people have ZERO morals, and they are completely unethical.\n\nThe completely inept and obviously un-educated receptionist trolls have zero manners and I think have no idea how to use their office software, maybe they're not properly trained? The manager was little help as well, saying basically that this is their policy. Whatever, at least own up to your own mistakes. Why waste my time?\n\nBottom line: Don't go here. The manager and the office monkeys give zero shits about you and your health. They are only there to collect your $$$. The nice office might be inciting, but what good will that do when they try to rob you of your hard earned income. No thanks.", "date": "2014-09-17 20:01:03"}

The veneers looked great, but I was still having some mild pain, so I got a root canal. Afterwards, I was still having mild discomfort, so I wrote Dr. Mapes an email. I was at this point a little frustrated because after a bunch of expensive procedures one of my teeth still did not feel normal. Doctor Mapes personally called me the next day in response to my email, and I went back in for a consultation. Turns out that the new surfacing on my tooth was causing my teeth to grind and cause a little bit of pressure, so he sanded it down a little and made a tooth guard for me right then.

The office is very nice and in a convenient location, and both the dentist and the receptionists seemed nice.  I went in for a consultation before I had the Groupon cleaning, because I was having some pain in my jaw and wanted to get it taken care of quickly.  Dr. Mapes took some xrays and said that the problem was a cavity.  I came in the next day and had it filled.  \n\nDr. Mapes hit a nerve while giving me anesthetic, and it was the most painful injection I've ever had.  (After the filling, I couldn't open my mouth wide enough to eat regularly for 10 days.)  The filling felt very strange afterwards - the shape was very different than pre-filling, it had edges sharp enough to cut my tongue on, and my teeth didn't close right.  I went in the next day to have him file it down, and he basically told me it wasn't his fault that the filling felt wrong.\n\nA few weeks later, I went in for my cleaning.  It was the most painful, bloodiest cleaning I've had in my life.  I've never felt anything close to this sort of pain at a dental cleaning before.  The hygenist blamed it on me.  I'll admit I don't floss every day, but I've never had a cleaning close to this painful or bloody before.  \n\nMeanwhile, the initial pain I came in for hadn't gone away, so I went in for another appointment.  Dr. Mapes took more xrays and said that there was actually another cavity in a tooth two teeth down from the first filling.  I asked why he didn't tell me about that one the first time, and he didn't have much of an explanation.  He said there was also another cavity on the other side, so I went in and had those two cavities filled.  They felt strange, just like the first one.\n\nThe pain still didn't go away, so I went to my long-time family dentist for a second opinion while visiting home at Christmas.  She took xrays and examined my mouth.  She then said that the three cavities Dr. Mapes filled were the worst examples of amalgam fillings she's seen in her career.  She explained that the cavities he did weren't even sealed.  Besides that, one of the cavities he filled was in a tooth that didn't even need to be filled!  The tooth that was actually causing me the pain was BETWEEN the two teeth he filled.  The second dentist repaired all of Dr. Mapes's work, at great cost, and said I might lose the teeth eventually because of his shoddy work.  \n\nWondering why Dr. Mapes appears to have such good reviews?  He gives you a whitening toothbrush on the way out the door if you write a good review while you're checking out. \n\nIf you're just going in for a cleaning, whitening, or something basic, I'm sure this office will be ok.  If you're having a cavity filled or anything more serious than that, DO NOT visit this office.  Save yourself the pain, trouble, and money.", "date": "2013-10-18 04:01:06"}

It was greatly discounted, so that convinced me to go for it. I had the impressions taken, then when I came back for a fitting, I was told that there was a problem with the fit, that the lab messed up. So I say, okay, I'll expect to come back in a week. No one called me. Meanwhile, I was going through finals, getting ready to graduate, leave New York, was kind of busy. Incidentally, a 40 minute subway ride each way is not ideally how one would spend their time in these circumstances.\n\nI call a couple weeks later, and was told I should have been called because the night guard was ready. I made it clear that I was upset, and Dr. Mapes apologized for his receptionist's screw up, which would have been all well and good, but then I was told the night guard didn't fit AGAIN and that this never normally happens. At this point I was starting to wonder who actually messed up the impressions. I was told this would be rushed, and I said it would have to obviously be ready before I left New York. \n\nGot called again, maybe a week later. Was told it was fine this time. At first the night guard didn't stay in at night at all, and it is a little wobby, doesn't fit exactly. I called (from CA by now) to ask if I could get a refund if there was a problem, and explained the problem. I was told that wouldn't be possible, and that there was no problem. An explanation/talking about the night guard would have been nice, rather than being told I could deal with it by having it sent to a lab or something here.\n\nIn sum, I'd say go here for a basic cleaning.

He basically dug out all of my previous work (that was actually fine based off of 2 other opinions) and therefore got closer to the roots in my teeth.  This in turn will cause pain that will last me the rest of my life but filled his pockets with lots of money.  Now all of my molars require constant attention since the fillings are so deep.

Like many other establishments in Ridge Park Square, this store is a bit run-down and has an abandoned feel to it.  That's not to say that you won't find good merchandise here, because you will.  Still, it's not as nice as other TJ Maxx stores.\n\nPersonally, I think wandering through the aisles here is a great way to waste some time before a movie at the AMC next door.", "date": "2010-02-08 01:50:54"}

The first time I went, I had a nice experience.  It's modern, clean, has TV/DVDS to watch, etc.  Seems like a really \"cool\" dentist.  Dr. Mapes was professional and normal.  I was quoted $1k+ for repairs to some damaged fillings.  I could not afford to do the procedures right off the bat, and don't have dental insurance, so I said I'd have to wait.\n\nWhen my 2nd appt. came around, I was bombarded by texts, phone calls, and emails confirming my appt.  I responded to each and every one.  The night before my 10 AM appt, my throat starting hurting and I went to bed at 8 AM.  I woke up at midnight and could barely swallow, my glands were so sore.  I called, texted, and emailed (3x) between Midnight and 9 AM when the office opened and I got no response.  I woke up at 9:45 and saw that no one had called me back...so I made one more attempt to contact them to see if I could reschedule.  At 9:52 I spoke to a receptionist who 'had no idea' what I was talking about, and literally told me \"We don't care if you are sick, we have gloves and masks.  If you can't be here in 8 minutes, you are losing your voucher.\"  It spiralled from there and she basically said \"We don't give a S*** because you are not a regularly 'paying' patient.\"  Then I spoke to the Office Manager, who gave me more attitude and had no explanation as to why no one bothered to call me back or acknowledge my 3 messages.  She said \"We have sold over 500 vouchers and if you can't make it or cancel in 24 hours then we cannot help you.\"\n\nWhat would've been nice, is if someone called me back at 8:45/9 AM when they open the office and check the voicemails.  They could've told me they would not be able to reschedule and then I could decide if I wanted to venture out of my bed to come in.  \n\nIt's bogus and obvious when businesses get overwhelmed with their Groupon sales, that they don't give a crap about the people who use them, as they are not REAL customers/patients. \n\nThe truth is, I had planned to schedule my appt.s for the $1k dental work and I won't be going back there now.  I didn't 'forget' about my appt. or just not show up and try to call after the fact...I contacted them multiple times and they were total A****holes about it.\n\nLAME treatment....so good luck Williamsburg Dental Smile keeping any of the 500+ customers who bought Groupon vouchers...I'm sure only a small fraction of those people will become long-term customers with this attitude.", "date": "2013-07-11 01:14:47"}

Couldn't even hear the rainfall :)\n- dog friendly : you just need to get a dog if you plan to live hear. \n- great for walks : the closed apartment area is secure with minimal traffic so you can see lots of people doing there walking. \n- maintanence is excellent : doesn't matter what kind of repair it is, the guys are so on top of it and quick to get the job done!\n- location: love that its right off 480 and walking distance to Ridgepark square. many a times did we walk over to AMC to get some popcorn and a late night movie, after buying some stuff at TJmaxx. 5 mins walk gets you to Texas Roadhouse, if you like steak. \n\nI'm sure there are more things to mention, but I think you get the picture, we LOVED this place. my wife of course wanted to stay longer but my job did not allow. \nAnyway, if you're looking for a place that's great for pets, small families, or singles, no need to look further.", "date": "2017-07-29 03:08:45"}

I'm confused.  About a couple things.\n\nBeginning to eat our take-out, something just wasn't quite right.  The receipt---sure enough---said Long John Silver's.  Then how was it possible that it tasted as delectable as $$$ Halibut dinners from Delmonico's in Independence?   Got me.\n\nIgnore the negative reviews.  Done.  Boom.  Whatever.\n\nA delightful surprise.  I had re-discovered Long John Silver's.\n\nOnce upon an afternoon drive down Brookpark on my way home, and knowing it was nearing time for sustenance, I spotted Long John's up ahead.   Some FISH---a favorite food stuff in our household---would be a perfect choice.  It had been many years since we ate at a LJS (one time...North Olmsted) because I was The Official Home Kitchen Fish Frier in town.  (Seven Seas...Lake Erie Perch)  While watching those prices going up, up, and UP---now at $15.99 per pound---and our *other* favorite Lake Erie Perch destination, the Red Lantern at Kamm's Corners, now closed---but hopefully, only temporarily---I fignured it was worth the gamble.  Other last minute fried fish pick-ups at the usual Big Name Fast Food suspects, always seemed to disappoint.   This one likely would, too, but it was right THERE...on my way HOME...so at the last moment I pulled in.   \n\nThe Stars, the Planets, and my SUV, were indeed, fortuitously aligned. \n\n~  EXCELLENT lightly-battered fried moist Cod (or might have been Pollock or other mild whitefish)\n~  EXCELLENT hushpuppies.  Never thought I'd ever write THOSE two words together.  Ultimate oxymoron.  The few I've had over the years were all positively nasty dry floury balls of horrid.  Until now.\n~  Fries and Tartar also far better than most others serving same.\n~  One of the nicest ever employees.  So naturally comfortably friendly with me.  Maybe I knew her...or met her somewhere else.  Could be, but probably not.  Just a nice person.\n\nPulled up reviews for the first time---just before writing mine.  Wow.  If I had read them beforehand---with the exception of Craig L.'s fairly recent 4 star---I would have probably sailed right past this fish food find.   Hope you have a remarkable visit like I did, and if you have, give LJS a break and help boost their star power by adding your reviews.  They deserve more positives. \n  \nI'm all for buying \"local\", but my definition also includes \"local humans\" who work in Chains and Big Boxes.   We can't forget about THEM---they have bills to pay and families to feed, TOO.\n.", "date": "2014-03-12 17:16:22"}

I pick up a pizza, get home and tried to eat even though the crust on the top was burnt, thinking it's only the top of the crust, so no big deal; well the pizza was burnt on the bottom as well, and the cheese was all dried up. So I call the business and ask to speak to the owner, well the guy on the phone tells me SHE is busy so I'll have to wait. After sitting on hold for a few minutes I hand up and call back, thinking they were busy. I get a woman on the phone and when I ask to speak to the owner, she informs me that she is the owner; so I go into what happened with my pizza and that I would like a new pizza delivered to me or my money back, at which points she asks me to hold, which I do for another couple of minutes until yet another woman gets on the phone and tells me shes the owner and asks me if I could help her. I'm a little upset now since the last lady lied to me and tell the owner about whom simply blows it off as well that was my daughter, so how can I help you. Well I tell her I don't know if she can since the last two people I've talked to haven't been much help and one even lied to me, again, she wants to get me off the phone and tells me if I'm not happy with the pizza to come back up to the store and get my money back.\nThen when I show up to the store some guy acting as the manager looks at my pizza and tells me there's nothing wrong with it and that I can't have my money back. At this point I feel like getting into an argument with them but really aren't in the mood, so I ask to speak with the owner, and when she comes over to me, she looks at the pizza and tells me she'll give me my money back, but there was nothing wrong with it.\nSo, my conclusion to this is that Geppetto's idea of a pizza is one that is dried out, and burnt both around the upper crust and the bottom of the pizza; so if you're looking for dried up burnt pizza, I would suggestion you go to Geppetto's at this location, AND if you're looking for attitude from the owner as well as everyone else who works there, this definitely is the place for you to go. AND of yea, if you want someone to lie to you about being the owner, and it's acceptable behavior on the actual owners behalf, then go here as well.", "date": "2011-02-07 17:24:15"}

There's just something about them that tends to turn my stomach. The dried out food, all those people rifling through the chafing dishes, dirty kids, it just doesn't normally translate into a good dining experience.  But this place, this unassuming place, it managed to play fast and loose with (some of) the rules. Here's the $13.99 rundown.\n\nHong Kong King Buffet. Where to begin. It was Christmas and we knew our options were limited. Chinese just felt right. The bright red letters, still managing to glow brightly amidst the washed out parking lot lights, looked imposing. The \"G\" was burnt out. Hon Kong King Buffet. The concrete lions guarding the entrance. The empty fountain in the foyer with dirt-encrusted coins lining the bottom. Empty probably because the fish that typically inhabit it wouldn't appreciate the Cleveland winter. Enter here but don't walk straight in - that's the exit. Turn left then right. That's it. No smiley forced greeting. It's a heavily accented \"Merry Christmas\" a grab of the menus and a short trip to the booth.\n\nThe large, open dining room is filled with tables, chairs, booths and efficiency of space is the key. There's not a wasted inch. A massive chandelier hangs as the centerpiece guiding you toward the dizzying array of culinary stereotypes that await you. There's not a single Chinese take-out menu item that hasn't been represented here. Row upon row, protected by sneeze guards, brightly lit. It's a Chinese food greatest hits album. Here's a sampling:\n\nGeneral Tso's chicken\nSweet and sour chicken\nChicken and broccoli\nPot stickers\nCrab Rangoon\nSesame chicken\nFried chicken wings\nSpare ribs\nBeef and broccoli\nChinese donuts\nPork egg rolls\nChicken on a stick\nWhite rice\nVegetable fried rice\n\nThe list goes on from there. If you like to play fast and loose with your gastrointestinal tract there's also a m\u00e9lange of seafood options with everything from clams to lobster claws and, dare I even mention it, sushi. Brightly colored cubes of white and pink fish, tightly packed rice enrobed in salmon and cod basking in the light of their display like raw fish jewelry. I didn't take a chance on them.\n\nThe beer options are like the freedoms afforded the Chinese people in their homeland - limited. Don't worry, there is the ubiquitous Tsing Tao (pronounce it ching-dow if you want to impress your waitress) and the usual light, fizzy yellow macros. They even have wine if you want to kick your buffet experience up a notch.\n\nFinish your dinner (two plate limit on seafood, please) there's a dessert bar, too. It starts, strangely enough, with multi-colored shrimp chips and then hits its stride. Cream puffs, chocolate chip cookies, finger food versions of chocolate, carrot and angel food cake, and sticky coconut macaroons. They are dry, of course, but worth a nibble if for nothing else but to round out your experience.\n\nThe food was predictable and, for the most part, tasty. It's exactly what you'd get from most of the Chinese take-out places around the city so there are no surprises. The service is quick, professional and curt. Your empty plates will be cleared nearly as fast as you can say won ton and your waters will never be empty. The meal finishes with fortune cookies and the check. As you're leaving be sure to say hello to the koi swimming around in the big tank next to the claw machine. They'll appreciate the attention.\n\nHong Kong King Buffet, for what it's worth, you will be forever part of one of our Christmas memories.", "date": "2013-12-26 15:50:12"}

The prices on their non multi pack envelopes is pretty good compared to other stores. They also accept credit card for even purchases as small as under $2.", "date": "2012-07-20 01:08:27"}

Every morning, a brown UPS truck would stop directly in front of my driveyway and make deliveries to this church. The unique sound of the UPS truck engine, the squeak of the brakes, and the single honk of the horn signified the recurring event. At that time, I called it \"ups\" instead of \"U-P-S\". \n\nThese days, as I ride the bus to work, I see a large UPS airplane flying into Cleveland Hopkins airport bringing the Cleveland area's UPS deliveries on a consistent schedule. A few minutes later, I usually see the FedEx airplane too! When I see these planes flying in the sky, I can't help but to think, \"There's the real Santa!\" These airplanes are not a far cry from the flying reindeer and sleigh bit either.\n\nThis UPS store is fast and efficient. I can count on the UPS truck making its daily pickup at 7:00 PM sharp. So I know I have to be there before that time to ensure my package goes out that day. And then my package will be taken to the UPS hub by the airport. From there, it gets loaded onto that plane and probably flown to the main Louisville, KY hub for distribution.\n\nWe take so much for granted with freight companies, but having worked for a global manufacturer, I learned more about shipping logistics. Having a brick and mortar presence close to home is very helpful for me. It helps me be a better ebay salesman. If I need to return an item via RMA to a manufacturer, this is where I go.\n\nNow, don't even think about using UPS (or Fedex, for that matter) to ship something back to China. You definitely want to use the USPS for that because it will cost a fraction of what UPS would charge you, unless you've been provided with a UPS pre-paid shipping label to China, but that would most certainly not happen. If you're shipping anywhere North America, UPS is usually competitively priced.\n\nThey sell shipping supplies such as boxes, labels, and tape and the service has always been fast and friendly for me.", "date": "2017-06-30 12:40:31"}

As far as other dishes, I don't know what to say because I don't know how to feel about entrees that tastes like nothing.  All of the sides are bizarre, shellacked under a layer of margarine or oil they exhibit that fresh-from-the-can taste.  Everything seems artificial -Should I be eating this?

The cable machines seem to be very popular as I always had to wait to use one and they have three of them!\n\nThe locker rooms are much bigger than Crocker's, but they were a bit on the dirty side. Also, old men walking around naked with no towel seemed to be a normal occurrence here, while it was rare to see at Crocker Park...ugh.\n\nI'm not sure if this was due to the Crocker location being remodeled, but this gym was constant packed with people after work!

However they were always reliable and on time. When I needed two large trees trimmed, because they had some very large branches hanging perilously over my house, a friend recommended Messner. I described what I needed, they sent someone out to see the trees and provide an estimate, and when I saw the job description of the written estimate ($900) I followed up by phone to make sure they knew everything I needed to do. I even made sure to schedule this for a day when I could be home to make sure they would be no misunderstandings. The guys who showed up were very nice and admittedly very hard working. However, they were sent out here without harnesses and just a handheld saw. That assured that they would be unable to do the job (if they had tried to climb the tall trees without a harness they would quite literally be risking their life). They even tried to reach a limb by climbing on the roof, but they couldn't reach it (in the attempt the saw fell off the roof slashing a window screen and bending the window's metal wrapping). In short, over roughly a 3 hour period I got some small branches removed at the cost of $300 an hour, and I still need to hire a real company to remove the dangerous tall limbs. For $900 you can lease a 2017 BMW 3 series for 3 months, buy 16 2017 Silver dollars from the US Mint, a round trip ticket to Paris and hotel for the weekend, or 128 pints of Haagen Dasz ice cream. Or, if you're not very bright (and I'm raising my hand with embarrassment), you can hire Messner for tree trimming and not get the job done.", "date": "2017-08-04 17:38:55"}

And I enjoy that at least one screen always has trivia on so you can passively play while you eat your food. \n\nOther than the delicious items I order every time, there's really nothing too remarkable about anything else here. The service is so-so. Last time we got to listen to the bartender bitching to the other bartender about just BEING there, for like 10 minutes. That's always fun. And I hate all the sports on 98% of all TVs, but it is a sports bar. And this is Cleveland. I've gotten quite used to drowning in constant sports chatter, shows, games--lives revolving around activities with balls (haha.)", "date": "2015-09-09 19:54:23"}

The crusty warm bread served with entrees is very tasty with the olive oil and spices served with it.\n\nWe belong to the dine rewards program.

I have never dined there before so my feelings and opinions were neutral from the start. I am not too big of a fan on chain restaurants in general, as they all appear to be bland across the board. I was satisfied with the menu selections, but disappointed with the portion sizes and the price for what you are paying for. I ordered a pasta dish that looked more like a luncheon portion then a dinner portion. It was luke warm, which tells me it was either reheated, or it sat under a heat lamp for quite some time.  The service was a tad bit too slow, as it was a slow weeknight evening, i would have expected fast service. I would recommend this restaurant for maybe a light lunch option, but most certainly not for dinner, unless you want to walk away hungry.

The first time was about 9 years ago and I was about 6 months pregnant with my son. I ordered some type of pasta with shrimp. It was a large portion of naked pasta with maybe 6-8 shrimp and had NO FLAVOR AT ALL.  I sent it back and ordered the chicken Alfredo which had the same issue. I ended up sending that back and not eating at all. The customer service was great. The waitress was very polite, apologetic and offered free dessert. So the food was  not great but it had a nice atmosphere, it was clean and had great customer service.....  My second time here was last night. My family decided to have dinner here for my aunts 55th birthday. I remembered going there years ago and not liking the food. But I was a VERY picky eater when I was pregnant with my son so I figured if they've been around this long, my prior experience had to be due to my own issues and it was a clean and the costumer was awesome so I agree to go. The first thing I noticed was the prices were way higher then they where 9 years ago, doubled if not tripled. Service was pretty good. We had a group of about 20 people and had 2 servers. Some of our group was late (me being one) and they were very patient with us. A bit unorganized but still very polite and attentive to us. The food on the other hand, not so great and definitely not worth the price. I ordered the lobster ravioli which came with a choice of soup or salad. The soup was amazing the ravioli, not so much. I received a plate with about 8 quarter sized ravioli and a drizzle of of Alfredo sauce. So my first thought is wow this is the portion for $18.99. So I eat one and again  there is no flavor at all. Then I eat a second one and realize I didn't even taste any lobster in them, no meat chunks of lister flavor. My son ordered shrimp and scallop with mashed potatoes and hated it! And this is a kid who loves seafood how ever it's prepared. The only he ate was the mashed potatoes. I taste his food and scallops were over done but seasoned pretty good and the same for the shrimp. Around the table, my family is asking for more sauce for their pasta, asking if their food can be reheated and even if they could try something else. Our servers were still awesome considering we were a large group full of complaints. Never did they seem annoyed of frustrated. They took care of us in a timely manner and we didn't have to asked for anything more then once. But for a $70.00 bill for food that I didn't eat and a pitcher of sangria punch that just tasted like juice (I mean really there was no alcohol in it al all) I wont be going back. The only reason I'll give it two stars is because the customer service is really good but not $70 good.", "date": "2016-10-30 20:19:12"}

Still, I can't say enough about the repeated satisfaction with every vist to this Carraba's.  I think what is truly exceptional here in addition to the superbly prepared selections and the welcoming service, must originate from the top.  The enthusiasm and responsiveness of the owner Mark exists at a level very seldom witnesssed in the food industry.  Mark is always willing to receive commentary and opinions on his establishment with the utmost interest and aplomb.  One often finds the opposite with other restaurants, with programmed responses to the extent of \"that's the way we do it, period.\"   You come to find yourself actually wanting to become a \"regular.\"   Creating this experience may be part of the corporate philosophy, but I also believe that Individuals such as Mark elevate it to a truly authentic and personal mission.  My dining experiences extend to a global level and include many memorable stops.  I can say, however, that it is a continued JOYFUL event to dine at Mark's Carrabba's grill.  \n\n\nUpdated March 6, 2017.  Upgraded rating to 5.

Wood fired grill makes the difference.   We've joined the frequent diner club and will be making this a regular event.  \n\n\nSometimes there is a perception that a corporate restaurant chain cannot adequately produce ethnic food that is authentic and good. Readily, I can subscribe to that opinion but I am not extremely disappointed if a white haired grandmother is not stirring the pot or if there isn't actually anyone of that certain ethnic background actually cooking. The true measure is in how well you are satisfied with what is served. I am actually more apt to accept a corporate entity because, as a former military member, I appreciate standards of performance and situational analysis. This visit to Carrabba's, while not a perfect 5.0 this time, was very, very good. The bread is crusty and warm; served with a dipping oil. The salads, though most likely, formulaic and not \"endless\" as another chain, were well presented, composed and served on a chilled plate; a superior extra element. Our choice of appetizers included aranchini (fried rice balls) and stuffed mushrooms. Good for the price point of around $6 each. The main entrees were a chicken and pasta dish titled Linguine Positano. Whether it is actually a dish that originates from Italy's Amalfi coast, I am unsure. The chicken had good grilled taste, but the pasta was horribly overcooked (which for the American taste is too acceptable.) The seasoning of the dish also lacked. (think I might order the sauce on the side next time so I can give a better analysis) My Cioppino (Seafood stew), on the other hand, was superb. The fish including shrimp, mussels, swordfish, and scallops, was prepared to order and not overcooked in any way. The broth was well seasoned and tasty. The only minus might be that there should be a bit more served (I liked it!!!) Pricing for the food appeared in line with most comparable sites though wines and other drinks might be slightly higher. Our server, Brittany, was bright and well informed and knew the company and its products well. Service seemed fairly well timed though the house was crowded. Would have liked to have had the wine a bit sooner so it was there with the first course. The process was admininstered well enough with multiple servers delivering courses and managers nearby. Spoke with the owner Mark for several minutes as he had learned of our displeasure with the pasta. I am always pleased to see that kind of attentiveness to customer opinion. He was very receptive to our thoughts and gave a very comprehensive insight into the preparation of their cuisine. On my file it or forget it rating, I give it a \"file it\" and worthy of another visit.", "date": "2017-02-13 00:08:33"}

My mother-in-law loves this place!  There were 10 of us, but we were seated quickly because it was Monday night and the place was next to empty.  \n\nI ordered the Chicken Trio and a Caesar Salad.  The lemon chicken was just so-so, the goat cheese chicken was just okay, but the Chicken Marsala was outstanding, yet again.  While I appreciate that they use organic chicken breasts, I miss the large breasts that I am used to at other venues.  No, not strip clubs!  Get your mind back on the menu!\n\nMy daughter ordered Lasagna and she ate it slowly, which means she didn't like it very much.  Her slow eating came to a grinding halt, so I tasted her Lasagna.  It really wasn't that good.  Actually, my wife bakes better Lasagna than this.\n\nI noticed several of those at the table did not eat their garlic mashed potatoes and I wondered why.  How can you screw mashed potatoes up?  Or was it that my in-laws just aren't used to eating them in their native Puerto Rico.  So I grabbed a fork full from an abandoned plate and tasted them.  They were overpoweringly seasoned with black pepper and way too much raw garlic.  Wow.  They were bad.  No wonder there were heaps remaining.\n\nThen I looked at my sister-in-law and niece's plates...they too were half full of uneaten alfredo pasta.  By this time, I was so full that I didn't have room to taste their pasta.  But I was tempted nonetheless.  I asked them how their pasta was, thinking they were simply overcome by a large portion.  Nope!  They both said it tasted bad.\n\nFinally, my mother-in-law said her Beef Brasato dish (you know, the one they're advertising on TV right now) was too heavily seasoned and she didn't finish it.  Since she is getting on a plane to San Juan in the morning, she said I could have her leftovers for lunch.  Not sure if that is a good thing considering the not-so-great-tasting-meal that we just ate.\n\nThis is my first disappointing visit to Carrabba's and I must remove one star for the overbearing taste.  Gah!  I also must remove it from my favorite restaurants list too!  This is getting to be a lot of work!  Maybe they were training a new chef?  Nope!  I watched them cook the meal and they all seemed perfectly at ease.\n\nMaybe because it was Monday it was an off night.  I don't know.  My water didn't get refilled until I begged a second time either.\n\nWhatever.  I'll reconsider visiting Carrabba's at this location on a Monday, to be sure.", "date": "2013-01-08 02:05:38"}

I took the wife and kids to the Showboat on Friday night for some dinner and it was a weird experience.\n\nWhen we walked in, it was quiet, too quiet, except for the Oldies music playing.  There were four patrons at the bar and the restaurant was empty.  Not one soul was in the restaurant area!\n\nWe were promptly seated and our server was very friendly.  She played with my son and made him laugh, so she got bonus points.\n\nBased on the name of this place, I expected more Cajun dishes.  The only dishes remotely close to what I perceive Cajun to be were the Jumbalaya and catfish.  Remember the Oldies music?  Yeah, that's not Cajun either.  \n\nThe decor consisted of dark green walls and large Mardis Gras masks everywhere.  It seemed overly simple or gimicky.  Also, there was a large stage, which was also empty.  Apparently, they had hopes and dreams of enough patrons visiting one fine day to justify hiring a jazz band.  Things that make you go, \"Hmmm.\"\n\nI ordered the perch with fries and a side of Jumbalaya (which wasn't on the menu), my wife ordered the catfish with fries, my daughter ordered a hamburger with fries, and my 18-month old son seemed like he was in the mood for Mac n Cheese.\n\nWe received bread rolls, which appeared to be store-bought, and soft butter, which was good.  The server brought the kids' food out first, which was nice of her, followed by our entrees a few minutes later.\n\nMy Perch was breaded and it tasted okay.  It was served with tartar sauce and cole slaw.  The fries were big and tasty, which I really liked.  The Jumbalaya was really tasty and my favorite dish of the evening.\n\nMy son ate all of his creamy Mac n Cheese and I tasted it too.  It was really good.  My daughter ate like two bites of her burger and a few fries.  She eats like a bird, anyway.  My wife ate most of her fish, but she didn't say anything about it, so I assume it was so-so.\n\nSince none of us had any extremely positive things to say, I assume we'll not be visiting this restaurant again.  With tip, the bill came to $47.\n\nAnother weird thing that happened was, a few groups of people walked in the restaurant only to turn around and walk right back out once they saw the emptiness.\n\nI didn't even know they were open and I work in this viscinity.  They should have given our HR department some coupons or some type of discount to drum-up business.\n\nOverall, the food was very average.  It wasn't great or anything.  It reminded me of cheap diner food, except for the Jumbalaya.  My main reason for giving this place two stars is the fact that it's a full-on restaurant and being the only guests on a Friday night soon after opening is just creepy.  You can't blame the lack of patronage on the economy...somebody just does not know how to run a business.\n\nI wonder how long this place will last.\n\nRun away.", "date": "2010-09-06 02:45:49"}

My lady and I had seen this place for quite some time and wanted to check it out.  We were hopefully of a new dining delight in the old Don Pablo's building.\n\nWe pulled up into the driveway and at first it seemed like there many cars, but soon we realized it was for the other near by places such as TGIFs, Steak'N\"Shake and the hotel.\n\nUpon entering the building it was interesting to see the change from Don Pablos to this....it was \"neat\"...loooked very fancy and I expected high prices...however they were not.\n\nBeing a New Oleans restaraunt, I expected to see some Crawfish....sadly No Crawfish on the menu! and No Boudin either.\n\nThe host polietly asked me if I preferred a booth or table and my reply was booth.  Nearly seconds later, he asked again, did you say booth or table? My reply was booth please (they place was nearly empty, and this was not a problem to find a booth)  Upon approaching the far side of the restaraunt, he asked me a 3rd time, Would you like a booth or table? I laughed and said a booth and joked with my girlfriend he must be high.\n\nOur server then came out, she was a bubbly girl who said she had been working there about 2 months.  She took our drink orders then came back and asked if we needed more time....I said yes and asked her for her suggestions and she suggested something (sorry I forget what it was) that didnt appeal to me as I kinda had my eye on the seafood paella.\n\nI asked her how it was and she said didnt like that kind stuff and that the texture was gross.  \n\nAt this point I didn not expect anything delightful from the rather uniquely atmosphered restaraunt.  \n\nWe were directed to the dumpling soup and a salad to accompany the seafood paella which we were to share......\n\nThe waitress....a friendly, bubbly young lady was quite enthusiastic and entertaining to speak to about the restaraunt and the \"show\".  She explained that the show gets pretty busy on the weekends and the bands are pretty good.  Truth being told the Band that was playing some kind of jazz blend was not too bad, and put me in a good mood.\n\nThe soup came out and was tasty.  Bread Rolls and salad did nothing to impress me.  While I love King hawaiin rolls from my grocer, this was a cheap immatation at best and the salad was pretty much just white iceberg.  We ate it and said nothing....\n\nMinutes later the Paella.\n\nI took one bite of a scallop and it was Raw.  I asked my date to confirm and she did.  I was poking around for a piece of andoullie....didnt seem to find one.....didnt get a chance too look much further...DIDNT CARE TO LOOK FURTHER when the waitress came back and asked how it was I said I was not pleased and i didnt want it fixed, just wanted it removed from the bill and id pay for salad and soup.\n\nShe kindly obliged and we recieved the bill and left the magical place with not very good food :)\n\n2 stars for ambiance, and good server\n\nnegatives\n-food not very good quality *but hey cheap prices sorta*\n-host forgetful of seating request", "date": "2010-10-18 14:17:28"}

We used to come to this location once a week.  Last time we were here, we were served raw chicken.  After waiting a year we decided to try again. Horrible.  We were sat in a pretty empty restaurant at 2:00 on a Sunday.  They sat a table beside us and took their order before us after waiting for at least 10 minutes.  Finally they took our order.  The people beside us got their food and left before we even were served our food.  When our food was served, it was cold. My husband ordered his without mushrooms and they said would he be able to just pick them out!  We sent back our food to get new hot food.  The food was just reheated. The plate was to hot to touch. I asked about them reheating it, they said they don't have microwaves.  Obviously it was heated with the plate IN something.  Manager came over to deliver the sauce and she was so fake and did not even apologize.  The service was way below par.  She acted like we were an inconvenience to be sitting in her section. Not one apology from anyone in this restaurant.  We were offered a dessert for our troubles, still with no apology.  We stated that we were full and didn't want dessert and could they just please take some money off the bill.  The took $6 off our bill.  The desserts range $6-$9.  What a freaking insult.   The server Mallory was rude and not friendly at all.  I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone.

They don't have 'em.\nJust because it's in bulk doesn't mean it's cheaper.\n\nYou can't help but be both amazed and disgusted with warehouse stores like Sam's. Nowhere on Earth can one witness the exorbitant excesses we as Americans are blessed with every day. Sam's is an Indiana Jones warehouse packed with everything. I'm pretty sure I saw the Ark of the Covenant crammed into a shopper's cart next to a 50-pack of Fruit Roll-Ups and 20 count Otis Spunkmeyer chocolate muffins. So what should you expect when you come visit Sam's Club? Here's a sampling:\n\n-Gallon jugs of something called \"extra heavy mayonnaise\". I'm both intrigued and a little sickened.\n\n-A toilet. Yes, you can purchase toilets here.\n\n-Tires for your car. Mmmm, that new tire smell.\n\n-A 70\" 240Hz 1080p LCD flat panel TV. I don't want to want it, but I do.\n\n-80oz of ranch dressing and 10lbs of wings. Can you say obesity epidemic?\n\n-Engagement rings. Because nothing says you care like jewelry from Sam's Club.\n\n-LED fireplaces. So cozy.\n\n-A food court with an actual crowd of people eating in it. I had no idea that soft pretzels, hot dogs and soda inside a warehouse club was destination dining.\n\n-An optical center. Is anyone else a little wary of buying glasses at a Wal-Mart company?\n\nI won't bother going over all of the features and benefits of Sam's Club. If you want that go visit their website. You pay for a membership so you can buy the things you normally buy in multiples that may or may not actually save you money. Will it help your wallet? Maybe, maybe not. Individual results may vary.\n\nI think that Sam's is really more for business owners than families anyway. Who the hell can use bulk quantities of fruit, bread and produce? However, if you're buying Snickers bars, beef jerky and Fanta in bulk for your family, I want to personally thank you for doing your part to destroy the healthcare infrastructure of this country. Why did I bother? How about a 40% generic prescription savings (Plus membership). That alone was worth the price.\n\nYou pretty much know what you're getting with Sam's Club.

Glad I found this. After reading the other reviews this was my only real choice in the area. It was June 28, 2018 and I sat at the \"outdoor bar\" they have built into a breezeway between the main building and a storage building. It functions perfect as the slight breeze was perfect shelter from the heat and I never recalled any road noise. \n\nStarted with a Yuengling draft from Jessica. The keg immediately ran out and rather than asking me to change my order or wait, she ran to the inside bar and got my pour without my expecting it. Menu and specials all looked great but I read about and asked Jessica if she would recommend the Wet 7 Pepper Wings and she let me know they were her fav. Ordered up and nobody was proven a liar. They were outstanding. Some of the best I've ever had.\n\nMy friendly neighbor had some great looking sliders and his wife had a \"big salad\". Every meal I saw plated looked great and the patron seemed to love it. I had a second beer (she ran inside again) before they changed the outdoor keg and finished with a mixed drink. \n\nIt was popular inside and out. I couldn't recommend this place more highly if you are looking for the friendly neighborhood dive joint with nice staff and great food.", "date": "2018-06-30 01:53:28"}

Jenny the manager said \"sure come in we make sure we get it all done together\" I wanted to make it a nice experience since they never had a pedicure.  I felt odd that the manager said just come in so when I got to my sisters house I called and spoke with Jenny again and told her we were on her way and would be there in 20 minutes.  The pedicures started out well only my poor sister's was half the time of mine and my nieces.  Then we were told to go ahead and get our eyebrows done since the 3 nail techs working just tool a client. We explained we would wait so we could stay together and talk and laugh but we were basically told if you want the waxing we had to do it then. While my sister was getting her brows waxed they told me i would get ny hair done.  So she started my hair and Jenny the manaher took  my niece and gave her a basic massage without the gel nail full set. The lady cut my har, then washed it and was going to send me out with wet hair. I reminded her I was paying for cut, blow out and style so with an attitude she used the blow dryer and my hai r was straight with no body or bump on the ends. By this time my sister was so angry they failed to do things the way we asked we left without getting our nails done.  I have had minor issues here before but this was the breaking point. When I confronted Jenny the manager she said it was my fault for wanting a hair cut.  Well your so called spa provides all these services. What a joke.  Waste of money.

The popular suburban and polished urban lunch break. The times I have been to Chipotle I believe I am marginalized in a goofy focus group pyramid marketing scheme. This review is not at all targeted as I believe an overstuffed burrito when prepared correctly is one of the most desirable meals on earth.\n\nThis location in Cleveland, Brooklyn draws venom. Saturday afternoon and polished new 'popular urban' music is far too loud. Songs with vaguely Spanish motifs spiked with some modern sterile recording punch together with new slinky pogo rock, far too loud. Chipotle seems to explicitly employ younger people so as to motivate you from any persuasion that their environment is anything but insufferably lame and contrived.\n\nI dislike them. This location has broad window view of Plain Dealer industrial printing facility. The view combined with atmosphere of restaurant makes a strange kind of awkward. Plain Dealer is basically in the dumps as a news source and the view made experience feel goofy. Reliably the Tiedeman Keybank workforce and hotel visitors back up lines out the door. I do not understand how Chipotle at this stage of their business maturity can actually do so well. Their food at this location and many others   has become less and less quality and they have steadily shifted increases with their prices.

Yeah, so not much has changed, other than the store layout. Sam's is very consistent, I'll give em that. One of my favorite things to buy here is clothes. You can find a good deal on generic jeans, shorts, and shirts. \n\nDid you know that Member's Mark bottled water is only 7 cents per bottle?  That's not bad. I believe it is the cheapest bottled water that you'll find - anywhere.\n\nI bought two Cleveland Cavaliers hoodies at a decent price and they made excellent Christmas gifts. In fact, both people who received them said they \"love\" the hoodie. One even said, \"this is now my favorite hooodie!\"  Go me!\n\nYou can't find cheaper gas prices at other gas stations. In fact, there are two gas stations next door to Sam's and nine out of ten times, Sam's is cheaper with their standard five cent per gallon discount. Oh, and Sam's just installed brand new gas pumps. The only issue I have with getting gas is the chatty people who patrol the gas pumps. I just want to get my gas and get out. I guess Wal-Mart is all about loss prevention.\n\nAnyway, I have a plus membership that I share with my mom, which actually earns us money. It more than pays for the annual fee. In fact, we make hundreds of dollars each year just by shopping at Sam's. We can use the kickbacks toward our membership too! Oh, and I can get into the club hours earlier than regular members as a perk of the plus membership.\n\nI wish Sam's offered a better selection of products like Costco. One thing that has changed for the better is I can buy one loaf of bread or one pack of tortillas or one bag of chips. They used to require you to buy two.", "date": "2017-01-01 17:23:46"}

We're foodie types, but we're not food snobs by any means. We went to Carrabba's because we were craving an unhealthy chain or diner type style of food (and I had a giftcard!). The service was fine, despite being slightly irritated that the bartender suggested that my ID was fake, since I'm young-ish and I have a an out-of-state ID. The Chianti was the special, and I enjoyed it. His Margarita was too sour for him, but the bartender set the expectation that it was a mix, so that's on us. We ordered quite a few things, and we didn't like any of it. The salad was coated and dripping with dressing. The minestrone was flavorless, and I suspect it wasn't cooked for very long, because the vegetables were undercooked. Plus, I like pasta in my minestrone, and it lacked that. The calamari was breaded with a breading that would be comparable to chicken strip breading,  and the squid itself was \"meh\". My lobster mac-and-cheese had a thin cheese sauce that didn't coat the noodles, and the lobster was terrible: it tasted like it was from a can-- very fishy smelling and tasting. He had an Alfredo and shells dish with chicken. I thought it was better than my dish, but he barely touched it. The sauce was runny, and the chicken (and the entire dish, for that matter) tasted and smelt frozen, like a frozen dinner. The food we ordered is pretty simple to do right, so there is no excuse for how bad it was. I understand why a chain would use frozen food, and I'd accept that if the establishment wasn't charging me over $15 for it. There are fine dining Italian restaurants with comparable prices, so if you're looking for good Italian, you certainly should look elsewhere. If you're looking for some fried food and some unhealthy, home-style cheesy dishes, buy a box of mac-n-cheese and bag of frozen fried items from Giant Eagle--because that would be better than eating at Carrabba's. Oh yeah, I also woke up in the middle of the night with indigestion, and I puked the following morning.  If you don't dig food poisoning, I suggest dining elsewhere. :)", "date": "2013-12-18 00:42:52"}

I waited at least 5 minutes, maybe more, before someone finally asked for my order and the guy was standing right in front of me, staring at his coworker. They're serving line is so unorganized, at least one or two of them kept walking away randomly and left other customers and myself waiting to finish our orders. I've had my fair share of Chipotle so I feel that I'm pretty accustomed to how they serve the food just like everyone and anyone who's been to Chipotle. There was such a disconnect with the employees from beginning to end of the ordering process. It extremely slows down the overall service. When I finally reached the register to pay, there was no one there. 5 minutes later, an employee was rushing to the register from behind me... where was she in the first place? There's already a long line forming.\n\nThe food, I love, no questions ask. I switch it up between chicken and steak every now and then, and the rest is my usual add ons. The portions they give at this location, on the other hand, is debatable. When I received my burrito bowl, I wondered if there was even anything in it because it was so light, I almost though it was empty. I ate half of my order and saved the rest for my boyfriend. Even he was wondering why I bothered saving the rest, I probably could've polished it off myself because there was so little.\n\nIt's a little disappointing since the location is great to hit up after going to the gym. I'll probably order ahead next time, if I'm not feeling the drive to the Parmatown location. Chipotle is great and all, but it wouldn't hurt to be a little more organized and give a little more. It could increase the speed of service and make customers a little happier.

Seriously. Not only are you selling sub-par merchandise to your customers, you're putting health at risk. \n\nThe remodels here look fantastic but I'm wondering at what cost. We moved out of state to NC before the remodels, and while we were down south I yearned for and often bragged about Giant Eagle's selection and abundance of fresh produce selection. BOY was that a shell shock when I got home and discovered my once beloved Giant Eagle now sucks. \n\nWe've actually been there before when they had visibly rotting produce (clementines are the ones I remember vividly) rotting on the shelf. I'm not talking over-ripe, I'm talking covered in white mold and seeping nasty syrupy juice all over the shelf. We one time made the mistake of sticking up on a bunch of produce, only to have it rot within 1-2 days. They refunded us and gave us a gift card, which was appreciated - BUT:\n\nPackaged foods aren't safe either. Have also had molded over tortillas (well before the expiration date). When I called the 1-800 number I was told that Giant Eagle wasn't responsible, the manufacturer was. Unless it's a GE brand product it's not their fault, she told me. What!? You're the one storing and selling it. I didn't buy it from the mfg, I bought it from GE. I was offered a refund, but who wants to drive out of their way back to the grocery store for $2.49 when you've already went grocery shopping for the month and did so after a shift at work? Not I. \n\nBottom line, I've had a lot of incidences like these and it hasn't been isolated. I can only assume to fund the excessive remodels they've lowered their standards of quality. I won't shop at any GE if I can avoid it now. \n\nAlso, they now sell craft draft beer in growlers, but the employees selling it have 0 knowledge of what they're selling and haven't even been trained on how to do a proper pour. I gave one nice sales lady some knowledge on both for her future reference. She didn't know when pouring a glass you needed to tip it so that you didn't wind up with all foam. At least one knows now.\n\nOn a side note, this location DOES have a very nice bottled beer selection, and the addition of the \"build your own 6 pack\" is really nice too.\n\nI would give GE just one store given my recent experiences, but I have also shopped here for literally all but one year of my life and know what they have, and could be, again.", "date": "2014-09-04 23:19:36"}

I hit them up regularly when traveling through Brooklyn, Mentor, Perry, Sheffield, Parma, Streetsboro and Ravenna. (Curse of having  living, working, church and family and friends scattered across the NEO landscape). Based on that, I cannot help but compare my experiences from store to store,\n\nWhen this location was being built I was giddy and could not wait - it's right down the road from my work and easy to hit for lunch or a quick drink as I head out to evening activities. and BONUS - they have a drive thru!  (Well, sorta bonus. Read on...) \n\n*The pros* - always open, coffee is always hot and fresh, and if your fave is missing they'll brew one up for you as quick as you can say the coffee Miranda rights - \"you have the right to fresh coffee, if you say anything to me before I have the coffee it will be held against you, and it won't be pretty. You sometimes have the right to free coffee thanks to loyalty rewards. If it's your 10th cup and you use your Sheetz card, this will be provided for you. Do you understand these rules? If not, it's probably lack of caffeine. You should just drink the fresh cup that's now ready and move along.\" \n\nThere food is also pretty tasty and a much better alternative to standard fast food. Customization is easy, using the touch screens provided indoors, and at the drive thru. If a sauce or something is missing, don't hesitate to ask as they are always willing to hook you up at this location. \n\nThey also own up to mistakes (inside) - twice I have been left standing and waiting for my treats for an extended/unreasonable for fast food amount of time, while others who came in long after me grabbed their goodies and ran. On both occasions the staff apologized, quickly got my food or beverage and also provided me with a nice little card for a free drink and $1 off my next MTO order. Pretty sweet.\n\n*The cons* - The drive thru is a disappointment and afterthought. If you want fast service it's far better to make the trek inside for your MTO items. There is never a staff member assigned to the area, and it's usually a frazzled cashier that's running everything else that takes your order, makes your order or tracks down your order. Unlike inside where they apologize for delays and acknowledge what is happening, when you are in the drive thru it's a black hole. Twice I've had to knock on the window to get someone's attention to wee that the hold up was on a pretty basic drink order. \n\nConsistency is also an issue. let's give cinnamon rolls as an easy example - on one visit, the peanut butter topping (which you pay extra for) is sufficient, and almost generous. The next visit, it looks like someone has placed you on a PB diet and been very stingy with the PB. If I pay $0.40 for some PB, I expect $0.40 worth. Otherwise, I should just buy a Reese cup and smoosh it on top the darn thing (see my pics posted for a visual of the PB land of feast and famine)\n\nSo, that's why this convenience center - with a nice selection of grab and go items (try the seasonal yogurt parfaits - they usually do not disappoint!) and fresh-made fast food (new guilty pleasure = fried cheese curds), and decent gas prices only ranked 4 out of 5 stars.", "date": "2015-01-29 18:38:23"}

I tried making reservations over the phone, assuming it would be a busy weekend for romance.  I was told they don't take reservations, but they do have a \"call ahead\" system that will let them know we're coming.  I have no idea how that helped them or us, as we still ended up waiting half an hour (in a very (!) crowded lobby area) to be seated.  \n\nHow can that be safe or sanitary with servers and restaurant staff weaving in and out of standing-room-only patrons?   \n\nLeah, our server, made it all better.  After our wait, we were sat in her section.  What a delight!  Not only was she super nice, but she did her job well.  We came two hours before closing and it was packed; and yet, Leah was smiling and pleasant and made us feel right at home the entire time.  We knew what we wanted to order right away, so she got us started on our glasses of wine (prosecco and blackberry sangria - yum!), warmed bread and garlic oil (double yum!), and the to-die-for bowl (get the large!) of Cozze in Bianco.\n\nWe completed our meal with an order of the Chicken Bryan and Sirloin Marsala.  With as busy as the restaurant was, I had a few fleeting images of the show, \"Hell's Kitchen.\"  You know, when the cooks fall apart in the kitchen because of the demanding crowds, the food suffers, and Gordon Ramsay's head starts spinning? Thankfully, that was not the case for us - with our perfectly prepared chicken breast and steak medium-rare.  Everything was spot on!  Leah kept our bread basket filled and treated us like friends.\n\nOnce we made it through the crazy lobby situation, the rest of our experience was worth repeating.", "date": "2013-02-19 21:25:33"}

First of all, it's fresh, hot, glorious and fast! I got this dish within mere minutes of ordering. Second of all, this is a lunch portion? For $6.99 I was expecting elf-size, to be honest. Then, this mound of delicious smelling fajita goodness was set in front of my face. Ummm, there's no way I could have finished all that food! It's a tremendous value. The chicken was tender, the veggies still had crunch and the spices were awesome. They serve it up to you with three flour tortillas, rice and beans. I will say the rice and beans were pretty average for this type of restaurant. \n\nThe endless chips and salsa were good, but again, typical. The margaritas were just meh, but at least you could taste the tequila! \n\nI would totally come back here if I was in the area.

I've been two both types and they have their pluses and minuses. El Tolteca falls somewhere in between the two. It's tasty, it's cheap and it's Mexican. What more do you want?\n\nEl Tolteca, which in Spanish means the Tolteca, is located in a strip mall in the city of Brooklyn (it's basically Cleveland). You really can't miss it with its enormous corner location and colorful signage. I know you're hesitating, reluctant to give in to yet another Americanized Mexi-joint, but hold fast. Give it a chance. \n\nWhen you walk in through the double doors and through the vestibule the first thing that hits you is how big the place is. You could probably play team jai-alai in this place. If I had to guess I'd bet it seats about 100 people comfortably. We were greeted by a smiling host as soon as we entered and ushered to our booth to the right in the main dining room. Sombreros on the walls, flat screens playing silent football, Dos Equis banners strung from the ceiling, El Tolteca has it all. I think I even saw a sign for live mariachi music. We all know there's nothing better than strangers with really big guitars playing loud ethnic music at your table side while you're eating. Moving on...\n\nWe were there on a Friday night about 7pm and the crowd was fairly sparse. Once we'd gotten situated in our booth someone stopped by with a basket of warm, crispy tortilla chips and a bowl of salsa. What? Complementary chips and salsa? Unheard of. Once past the initial shock of free munchies we started to wander through the menu. The menu, actually a little booklet, is huge. Filled with every conceivable combination of meat, beans and rice imaginable if it's Mexican it's in here. Burritos, sopes, tamales, flautas, fajitas, chimichangas, carne asada, the list is mind boggling. The bottom line is, you will find something to eat.\n\nI'm a craft beer geek so I rarely stray, but when doing Mexican I have to have a Mexican beer. $3.25 for a bottle of ice cold Negra Modelo. Nice. Here's how our meal went:\n\nCheese Dip - Oozy, gooey, cheese, melty goodness in a little bowl. This was way better than the usual orange processed stuff you normally get on nachos.\n\nThe No. 2 (go ahead, laugh) - Taco, enchilada and chalupa combo platter. My wife opted for the pollo variety and was quite pleased. The chalupa, a flat. crispy corn tortilla topped with refried beans (the real deal, no vegetarian beans here), juicy, well-seasoned shredded chicken, lettuce, guacamole, onion, and tomato. The taco, crispy variety, was traditional and tasty and the enchilada, a corn tortilla wrapped around chicken and covered in a red chile sauce, was delicious.\n\nThe No. 23 - Burrito, tamale and chalupa combo platter. The burrito was soft and the ground beef inside was seasoned well. The tamale, one of my favorites of the dish, was yummy. The steamed masa (cornmeal dough) was soft and flavorful and the red sauce added just the right amount of heat. See above for the chalupa.\n\nSure, it's in a shopping plaza next to a Salvation Army thrift store. Sure, it reeks of Mexi-kitsch and sure it has all the makings of a stereotype, but damn, it's good. The authentic service was very friendly and prompt. It actually seemed like our server was happy to serve us. Did I forget to mention that our total bill, including two beers, came to just under $24. There aren't too many places where you can get a meal for two and walk out the door for less than $40 anymore. We actually had leftovers so we got a lunch out of it, too. Go here now.", "date": "2012-12-29 15:40:24"}
